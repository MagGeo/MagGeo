# MagGeo Annotation Program - Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains the principal Jupyter Notebooks that originated **MagGeo**. These notebooks are designed to guide researchers step by step through the annotation process and demonstrate how information is manipulated throughout the workflow.

## Contents
- **MagGeo - Home.ipynb**: The main notebook that provides an overview of the Earth's magnetic field, the calculation of magnetic components, and the overall workflow of the MagGeo annotation process.
- **MagGeo - Sequential Mode.ipynb**: A notebook that demonstrates the sequential mode of the MagGeo annotation process, where the magnetic components are calculated for a single GPS trajectory.
- **MagGeo - Parallel Mode.ipynb**: A notebook that illustrates the parallel mode of the MagGeo annotation process, allowing for the calculation of magnetic components across multiple GPS trajectories simultaneously.
