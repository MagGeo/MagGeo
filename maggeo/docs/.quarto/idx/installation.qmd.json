This guide will walk you through installing MagGeo on your computer, even if you're more familiar with R than Python.\n\n## What You'll Need\n\nBefore we begin, understand that **MagGeo** is currently built using Python (similar to how some R packages depend on specific R versions). We'll set up a contained environment so it won't interfere with any existing R installations or other software on your computer.\n\n## Step 1: Install Miniconda (Your Python Environment Manager)\n\n**What is Miniconda?** Think of Miniconda as a package manager for Python, similar to how CRAN manages R packages. It creates isolated environments so different projects don't conflict with each other.\n\n### For Windows Users:\n\n1.  Visit <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>\n2.  Download the \"Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit\" installer\n3.  Run the downloaded `.exe` file as administrator\n4.  Follow the installation wizard:\n    -   Accept the license agreement\n    -   Choose \"Just Me\" installation\n    -   Use the default installation location\n    -   **Important:** Check \"Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable\" (even if it shows a warning)\n5.  Click \"Install\" and wait for completion\n\n### For macOS Users:\n\n1.  Visit <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>\n2.  Download the \"Miniconda3 macOS 64-bit pkg\" installer\n3.  Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file\n4.  Follow the installation wizard using default settings\n5.  The installer will automatically add conda to your PATH\n\n**Verification:** After installation, open a new terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type `conda --version`. You should see a version number.\n\n![](images/paste-1.png){width=\"484\"}\n\n## Step 2: Clone MagGeo\n\nYou will need to clone the MagGeo repository in your local computer (we are currently working to make make MagGeo available in `pip` to an easier installation), for now simply clone it and you will have access to all MagGeo.\n\nIf you don't have **Git**, or you are not use to work with version control, you will need to install git to clone any repository from GitHub\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Installing Git\n\n**What is Git?** Git is like a sophisticated \"track changes\" system for code, similar to version control in collaborative documents. We need it to download the MagGeo software.\n\n### For Windows Users:\n\n1.  Visit <https://git-scm.com/downloads>\n2.  Download \"Git for Windows\"\n3.  Run the installer with these recommended settings:\n    -   Select \"Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt\"\n    -   Choose \"Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings\"\n    -   Use all other default settings\n\n### For macOS Users:\n\n**Option A (Recommended):**\n\n1\\. Open Terminal (found in Applications \\> Utilities)\n\n2\\. Type `git --version` and press Enter\n\n3\\. If **Git** isn't installed, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools\n\n4\\. Click \"Install\" and follow the prompts\n\n**Option B:**\n\n1\\. Visit <https://git-scm.com/downloads>\n\n2\\. Download \"Git for macOS\"\n\n3\\. Run the installer with default settings\n:::\n\n### For Both Windows and macOS Users:\n\n1.  **Open your command line interface:**\n\n    -   **Windows:** Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter\n    -   **macOS:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type \"Terminal\", press Enter\n\n2.  **Navigate to your desired location** (optional but recommended):\n\n    ``` bash\n    # Windows users:\n    cd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\n\n    # macOS users:\n    cd ~/Documents\n    ```\n\n3.  **Download MagGeo:**\n\n    ``` bash\n    git clone https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program.git\n    ```\n\n    This creates a folder called \"**MagGeo-Annotation-Program**\" with all the necessary files.\n\n## Step 4: Navigate to the MagGeo Folder\n\n``` bash\ncd MagGeo-Annotation-Program\n```\n\n## Step 5: Create the MagGeo Environment\n\nThis creates a specialized Python environment with all the specific packages MagGeo needs, similar to installing a comprehensive R package with all its dependencies.\n\n``` bash\nconda env create --file environment.yml\n```\n\n::: callout-warning\n**This process will take 5-10 minutes** as it downloads and installs all required components. You'll see progress messages - this is normal.\n:::\n\n## Step 6: Activate the MagGeo Environment\n\nEvery time you want to use MagGeo, you'll need to \"activate\" its environment first:\n\n``` bash\nconda activate MagGeoEnv\n```\n\n**What this does:** Switches your command line to use the MagGeo-specific Python environment, ensuring all the right tools are available.\n\n## Step 7: Set Up VirES Access (Magnetic Field Data)\n\n**What is VirES?** VirES provides access to satellite magnetic field data from ESA's Swarm mission. Think of it as a specialized database for magnetic field measurements that MagGeo uses to understand the magnetic environment your animals experienced.\n\n**MagGeo** use [**VirES**](https://swarm-vre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swarm_notebooks/02a__Intro-Swarm-viresclient.html) (Virtual environments for Earth Scientists) a platform for data & model access, analysis, and visualization for ESAâ€™s magnetic mission **Swarm**. This is a powerful client with the [viresclient API](https://swarm-vre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swarm_notebooks/02c__viresclient-API.html) that provide several classes and methods defined in the vires client package. The `viresclient` Python package allows you to connect to the VirES server to download [Swarm](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/swarm) data and data calculated using magnetic models.\n\n### Create Your VirES Account:\n\n1.  **Sign up:** Visit <https://vires.services/oauth/accounts/signup/>\n\n    -   Use your institutional email if possible\n    -   Create a secure password\n    -   Verify your email address\n\n2.  **Log in:** Go to <https://vires.services/>\n\n3.  **Get your access token:**\n\n    -   Follow the detailed instructions at <https://viresclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_token.html>\n    -   Your token is like a password that allows MagGeo to download data for you\n    -   **Important:** Keep this token secure and don't share it\n\n4.  **Configure MagGeo with your token:**\n\n    ``` bash\n    # Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token\n    viresclient set_token --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\n    ```\n\n## Testing Your Installation\n\nTo verify everything is working:\n\n1.  Make sure you're in the MagGeo directory and the environment is activated\n2.  Try running a simple test (specific commands will depend on MagGeo's documentation)\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Windows-Specific Issues\n\n**Problem:** \"conda is not recognized as an internal or external command\"\n\n-   **Solution:** Miniconda wasn't added to PATH during installation\n\n-   **Fix:** Reinstall Miniconda and ensure you check \"Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable\"\n\n**Problem:** \"Permission denied\" errors\n\n-   **Solution:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator\n\n-   **Fix:** Right-click Command Prompt and select \"Run as administrator\"\n\n**Problem:** Long path names causing issues\n\n-   **Solution:** Install MagGeo in a shorter path like `C:\\MagGeo`\n\n### macOS-Specific Issues\n\n**Problem:** \"command not found: conda\"\n\n-   **Solution:** Terminal doesn't recognize conda\n\n-   **Fix:** Close and reopen Terminal, or run `source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n**Problem:** \"Permission denied\" during Git clone\n\n-   **Solution:** You don't have write permissions in the current directory -\n\n-   **Fix:** Navigate to your home directory first: `cd ~`\n\n**Problem:** Xcode Command Line Tools installation fails\n\n-   **Solution:** Install Xcode from the App Store first, then try again\n\n### General Issues\n\n**Problem:** Environment creation fails with package conflicts\n\n-   **Solution:** Clear conda cache and try again\n\n-   **Fix:** Clean your conda enviroment cache and reinstall the MagGeo environment.\n\n```         \n`conda clean --all`\n\n`conda env create --file environment.yml`\n```\n\n**Problem:** VirES token authentication fails\n\n-   **Solution:** Token might be incorrect or expired\n\n-   **Fix:** Generate a new token from the VirES website and reconfigure\n\n**Problem:** Git clone fails with \"Repository not found\"\n\n-   **Solution:** Check your internet connection and the repository URL\n\n-   **Fix:** Try cloning again, or download the ZIP file directly from GitHub\n\n## Reporting an Issue\n\nIf you encounter issues not covered here:\n\n### Before Reporting an Issue:\n\n1.  Note your operating system (Windows 10/11, macOS version)\n2.  Copy any error messages exactly as they appear\n3.  Note which step in the installation process failed\n\n### How to Report an Issue:\n\n1.  Visit <https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program/issues>\n2.  Click \"New Issue\"\n3.  Choose \"Bug report\" or \"Installation help\"\n4.  Provide a clear title like \"Installation fails at Step 5 on Windows 11\"\n5.  Include:\n    -   Your operating system\n    -   The exact error message\n    -   What you were trying to do when the error occurred\n    -   Screenshots if helpful\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce installation is complete:\n\n-   Read the MagGeo user guide for analysis workflows\n\n-   Prepare your animal movement data according to the format requirements\n\n::: callout-tip\nRemember: You only need to install MagGeo once, but you'll need to activate the environment (`conda activate MagGeoEnv`) each time you want to use it.\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"installation.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
