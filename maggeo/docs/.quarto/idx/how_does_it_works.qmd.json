Get the Swarm data**, particularly the magnetic residuals in the NEC components. **2. Run the Spatio-temporal kernel** where the script will filter the Swarm data based on our spatial-temporal cylinder, to interpolate the magnetic components in the NEC frame for the given GPS track. Finally using the enriched GPS track, the final step will be the **3. Calculation of Magnetic Components** which use the CHAOS model to compute the magnetic components at the ground level. With the interpolated magnetic values corrected by the ionospheric contribution. The script will compute the other magnetic components including F (magnetic intensity), H (Horizontal component), Declination and Inclination. For detailed information of this process go to the Main Notebook.\n\n```{=html}\n<img src=\"./images/Workflow21042021.png\"\n width=\"800\">\n```\n\n## Interpolation (ST-IDW) and Annotation Process\n\nOnce we have requested the data we need for each point in the GPS Track and considering we have gathered the available data from the three satellites for one day ( *24 hours, every 60 seconds around 1440 Swarm measures per satellite*). Now we need to `filter` in space and time the available points to compute the magnetic values for each GPS point in its particular date and time. Therefore, before running the interpolation process we set **four** functions that will require the *latitude* and *longitude* and the *epoch* time of each GPS point to filter the Swarm points into what we called **Space-Time Cylinder**. The following picture can provide a better explanation about how the points inside the space-time cylinder are included or excluded. **Figure I**, shows how the R of the Space-Time cylinder is based on the GPS point latitude. **Figure II**, illustrate the geometric components behind the space-time cylinder where the points are filtered and included in the interpolation process. Figure B, will help you to understand how the following functions compute the required parameters **Figure III** shows the idea behind the interpolation process for each GPS point, requesting and processing the available Swarm measures by the three satellites. For more information about the time-space windows please read the full paper where we explain the details of it.\n\n<img src=\"./images/ST-IDWGitHub.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n::: {.alert .alert-info role=\"alert\"}\n<strong>ðŸ“˜ SwarmMagAnnotation function:</strong>\n\nWorking as the main function for the annotation process, this functions meets the previous functions running the space-time window filters, and the computing the <code>ST- IDW process</code>. This function will run a interpolation process for each GPS Point considering only the Swarm points inside the Space-Time cylinder computed by the four previous functions. The return value will be an array with the values the annotated magnetic values for the GPS point. The function will be executed inside a loop going through the GPS track. This function is the annotation process per se, and through this process at first we run the interpolation getting the magnetic values in NEC reference frame and then we compute the extra magnetic values that are useful to get a better understating of the earth's magnetic field at this particular location, date and time.\n:::\n\nTherefore, before running the interpolation process we set **four** functions that will require the *latitude* and *longitude* and the *epoch* time of each GPS point to filter the Swarm points into what we called **Space-Time Cylinder**.
