    "section": "",
    "text": "What’s MagGeo\n\nMagGeo is a tool that helps ecologists or animal movement researchers to link earth’s magnetic field data from satellite source to GPS trajectories. Inspired by the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) Service a tool from Movebank and help researcher to get a better understanding about the geomagnetic variations across the GPS trajectories.\nMagGeo is entirely built-in python and includes a two Jupyter Notebooks that offer two ways to link GPS tracks with the geomagnetic components using the data from one of the up-to-date satellite sources - Swarm Constellation. MagGeo will create an enriched GPS track with the following components:\n\nLatitude from the GPS Track.\nLongitude from the GPS Track.\nTimestamp from the GPS Track.\nMagnetic Field Intensity mapped as Fgps in nanoTeslas (nT).\nN (Northwards) component mapped as N in nanoTeslas (nT).\nE (Eastwards) component mapped as E. in nanoteslas (nT).\nC (Downwards or Center) component mapped as C in nanoTeslas (nT).\nHorizontal component mapped as H in nanoTeslas (nT).\nMagnetic Declination or dip angle mapped as D in degrees\nMagnetic Inclination mapped as I in degrees\nKp Index mapped as kp\nTotal Points as the amount of Swarm measures included in the ST-IDW process from the trajectories requested in the three satellites.\nMinimum Distance mapped as MinDist, representing the minimum distance amount the set of identified point inside the Space Time cylinder and each GPS point location.\nAverage Distance mapped as AvDist, representing the average distance amount the set of distances between the identified Swarm Point in the Space Time cylinder and the GPS Points location.\n\nResearchers, particularly ecologists now can study the annotated table to analyze the geomagnetic Spatio-temporal variation across any GPS trajectory.\n\n\nSuggestions?\nMagGeo is work in progress and we are constantly making improvements that you can follow up with the commits made in the pubic GitHub repo. For general inquiries, scientific concepts, suggestions please email: Fernando.Benitez@st-andrews.ac.uk, ud2@st-andrews.ac.uk, jed.long@uwo.ca\nFor errors, or improvements please submit an issue in this repo, describing the problem.",

    "text": "Inspired by The Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) Service a tool on Movebank, where ecologists and animal movement researchers all over the world can link movement data with global environmental datasets. Including hundreds of variables from a diverse set of data sources including the European Space Agency (ESA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and others. EnvData allow researchers to annotate in space and time multiples environmental information to enrich their GPS tracks to analyze the influence of several environmental variables in the trajectory. Using the Env-DATA Track Annotation Service registered users on MoveBank are able to get environmental parameters—such as wind conditions, land use, vegetation, and snow cover—for the whole world. Using different interpolation methods users can include multiple environment variables selecting from a comprehensive list of datasets (you can browse the available dataset here).\nThe second element that inspired MagGeo is having a tool to help researcher to get a better understanding over how the earth’s magnetic field is being used by birds as one of their navigational strategies. Despite of there are several approach in this regards we know still have little knowledge about how birds can use the influence of the magnetic field for their migration patterns, especially for those long-distance migratory animals. Other studies have been reflecting into the magnetic field influence based on magnetic field estimation models, or using some displacement experiments with particular species. The disadvantage of those previous studies is the magnetic field is a highly dynamic force that have different impact around the earth every day. Having said that MagGeo wants to take advantage of what is considered best survey of the geomagnetic field and its temporal evolution - Swarm Constellation. Swarm is a ESA’s magnetic field mission, launched on 22 November 2013, consists of the three identical Swarm satellites (Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie). Swarm A and C flying side-by-side (1.4° separation in longitude) at an altitude of 462 km (initial altitude) and Swarm B at higher orbit of 511 km (initial altitude) are equipped with the following set of identical instruments.\nThe data products available from Swarm are Level 1b and Swarm Level 2 products. These products include Swarm magnetic field models, ionospheric and thermospheric products, and others. MagGeo use the Swarm Level 1b data product as the corrected and formatted output from each of the three Swarm satellites. For more information about the Swarm Data Products click here.\nMagGeo has been deployed using a set of Jupyter notebooks a powerful tool to run a python environment. Completely build in python 3.8 MagGeo is a well described program that will guide you through several steps to annotate your GPS trajectories with the geomagnetic field components reported by Swarm. You can access to Swarm Data products via HTTP or FTP using :\n\nvia any HTTP browser at http://swarm-diss.eo.esa.int\ndirectly via an ftp client at ftp://swarm-diss.eo.esa.int\n\nHowever MagGeo use VirES (Virtual environments for Earth Scientists) a platform for data & model access, analysis, and visualisation for ESA’s magnetic mission Swarm. This is a powerful client with the viresclient API that provide several classes and methods defined in the vires client package. The viresclient Python package allows you to connect to the VirES server to download Swarm data and data calculated using magnetic models.",

In our example it only takes 4 seconds.\n\nAnd Congrats you got annotated data. The results will be stored in the folder results for your futher analysis. You will find a .csv file named like GeoMagResult_+name_of_your_csv_file_trajectory.\n\nRun MagGeo using your data.\nIf you are ready to annotate your GPS trajectories. You need to update the parameters file in MagGeo to let the program know what are the correct values of your data.\n\nCopy the csv file with your trajectories into the data folder.\nOpen and Update the following parameters in the file default.yml located in parameters folder:\ngpsfilename: \"name_of_your_trajectory.cvs\" Include the name of your Input data.

Using a traditional loop to going through the GPS track rows and process every row computing the magnetic components. Particularly useful for small datasets.\nParallel Mode: If you have a “big” dataset ( e.g. 1 million of records) you might want try the parallel mode. The parallel mode has some differences when you run the required libraries in a windows or Linux environment. We have tested MagGeo in a windows server environment.\nNotebook basics: If you are not familiar with Jupiter Notebooks and want to learn about the basics over how to run the notebooks before try the annotate tool. You can try this notebook to get the basics elements to run cells, read data, and plot some a basic chart.\n\nThe following image will help you to understand how the sequential and parallel mode differ, and how in parallel mode you should be able to use the full capacity of your machine.

    "text": "2.0.1 True Navigation\nLong-distance migratory navigation represents one of nature’s most remarkable phenomena, consisting of two primary components that work together to enable animals to travel vast distances with inexplicable precision. The first component, is compass orientation, involves determining the correct direction of movement relative to environmental cues (where to go). The second component, geographic positioning, requires animals to know their current location at any specific time during their journey (where am I)¹.\nThese mechanisms together support what Ecologists term “true navigation” - defined as the ability to find the way to a distant, unknown location using only cues that are available locally at the animal’s current position².\n\n\n2.0.2 Navigation Mechanisms\nMigratory animals (e.g Birds) have evolved sophisticated sensory systems that can detect and interpret multiple environmental cues for navigation purposes (Demšar, Zein, and Long 2025). These cues fall into two primary categories based on their navigational function:\nFor Compass Orientation: Animals use several types of compass systems to maintain consistent directional movement:\n\nSolar compass: Utilizes the Sun’s position, accounting for its apparent movement across the sky and seasonal variations\nStellar compass: Relies on star patterns and celestial rotation, particularly useful during nighttime migration\nPolarized light patterns: Detects polarization patterns in skylight that remain consistent relative to the Sun’s position\nEarth’s magnetic field: Uses the planet’s magnetic field as a reliable directional reference³⁻⁴\n\nFor Geographic Positioning: To determine their specific location, animals can access several types of positional cues:\n\nEarth’s magnetic field: Utilizes spatial gradients and patterns in Earth’s magnetic field intensity and inclination³\nOlfactory cues: Chemical signatures that vary geographically, creating olfactory landscapes⁵⁻⁶\nVisual landmarks: Topographical features, coastlines, and other geographical markers⁷\nInfrasound: Low-frequency sound waves that can travel long distances and vary by location¹",

Geomagnetic Navigation\nGeomagnetic navigation represents a strategy whereby animals use information derived from Earth’s magnetic field for either compass orientation, geographic positioning, or both functions simultaneously³. This navigational mechanism has been documented across an taxonomic range, suggesting it evolved independently multiple times or represents an ancient, conserved ability.\nEvidence for geomagnetic navigation exists across diverse taxa:\n\nBirds: From songbirds to seabirds, with extensive experimental evidence¹⁻⁷\nFish: Including both oceanic and freshwater species⁹\nSea turtles: Particularly well-documented in marine navigation⁸⁻¹⁰\nTerrestrial mammals: From small rodents to large ungulates¹¹⁻¹²\nMarine mammals: Including whales and dolphins¹³⁻¹⁴\n\nHowever the study of geomagnetic navigation employs two primary methodological approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations:\nLab Experiments: Controlled studies where animals are placed in artificial magnetic field to examine how magnetic parameters influence the onset and direction of migratory behavior. Laboratory experiments provide exceptional precision and experimental control, allowing researchers to manipulate specific magnetic parameters while holding other variables constant²⁻⁷⁻¹⁵⁻¹⁷. However, the observed behaviors in such controlled environments differ significantly from what occurs in wild¹. Additionally, these studies typically focus on small numbers of individuals from single species, which limits the results across multiple species¹⁹.\nField Studies with Tracking: Modern migration research employs tracking technologies, particularly GPS tags combined with displacement experiments. These approaches provide greater ecological relevance by studying animals in their natural environments¹⁸⁻²⁰⁻²¹. However, most tracking studies have been limited by their reliance on static representations of the geomagnetic field (space and temporal), failing to account for the dynamic temporal variations that may influence animal navigation²².",

    "text": "2.2 3. Earth’s Magnetic Field\nEarth’s magnetic field is a complex, dynamic system that results from the superposition of magnetic fields originating from multiple sources. Understanding this complex environmental variable is crucial for comprehending how animals use magnetic data for navigation. The total magnetic field at any location and time results from the combination of three primary components, each with different characteristics, spatial patterns, and temporal behaviors³⁴.\nCore Field: The dominant contributor to Earth’s magnetic field is the core field, generated by the geodynamo mechanism operating within Earth’s outer liquid core. This field arises from the motion of electrically conductive molten iron as it circulates within the outer core, driven by thermal convection and the planet’s rotation. The core field exhibits a broadly dipolar structure on large scales, resembling that of a giant bar magnet tilted approximately 11 degrees from Earth’s rotational axis. However, this apparent simplicity masks considerable complexity in the detailed structure, with significant non-dipolar components that create regional variations in field strength and direction across the globe.\nThe core field dominates the total magnetic field at Earth’s surface, typically contributing over 98% of the field strength at any location. This field undergoes gradual changes over time scales of years to decades, known as secular variation, as the circulation patterns within the outer core evolve. These long-term changes can amount to tens of nanoTesla per year at any given location, representing a slow but persistent evolution of the magnetic environment that animals experience.\nLithospheric Field: The lithospheric or crustal field originates from the magnetic properties of rocks within Earth’s crust. Certain minerals, particularly magnetite and other iron-bearing compounds, became magnetized when they formed and retain this magnetization over geological time scales. The lithospheric field creates local and regional magnetic anomalies - areas where the magnetic field strength or direction differs noticeably from what would be expected from the core field alone.\nThese magnetic anomalies can range from subtle variations of a few nanoTesla to dramatic variations of thousands of nanoTesla over distances of kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. The lithospheric field is considered essentially static over time periods relevant to animal lifespans, changing only over geological time scales of millennia or longer. For migratory animals, these crustal magnetic signatures provide potentially stable, location-specific magnetic features that could serve as magnetic landmarks or components of magnetic maps.\nExternal Fields: External magnetic fields result from electrical current systems flowing in Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere, driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field. These fields exhibit the most dynamic behavior of the three components, varying on time scales from seconds to days. The external field contributions include both regular, predictable daily variations and irregular disturbances associated with space weather events.\nThe regular daily variations, known as Sq (solar quiet) currents, result from the regular heating of the ionosphere by solar radiation, which creates predictable current systems that vary with local time and season. These regular variations typically amount to 20-30 nanoTesla at mid-latitudes but can be significantly larger at high latitudes near the magnetic poles.\nFigure 1 showing magnetic field components and coordinate system, NOOA, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/HDGM\n\n2.2.1 Magnetic Field Measurements and Coordinate Systems\nScientists measure Earth’s magnetic field using a standardized coordinate system that allows for consistent description and comparison of magnetic field vectors worldwide. The magnetic field vector B is decomposed into components using the North-East-Centre (NEC) coordinate system, also known as the local geodetic coordinate system.\nIn this system, measurements are made relative to the local geographic reference frame at each point on Earth’s surface. The North component points toward geographic north (true north), the East component points toward geographic east, and the Centre component points radially downward toward Earth’s center. This coordinate system provides a consistent framework for describing magnetic field variations across the globe and through time.\nFrom these three orthogonal components, several important magnetic field parameters are derived:\n\nIntensity (F): The magnitude or total strength of the magnetic field vector B, representing the length of the vector in three-dimensional space\nInclination (I): The angle between the magnetic field vector B and its horizontal component H, measuring how steeply the field lines plunge into or emerge from Earth\nDeclination (D): The angle between the horizontal component H and geographic north, indicating how much magnetic north deviates from geographic north\nHorizontal component (H): The horizontal projection of the magnetic field vector, representing the component parallel to Earth’s surface\n\nThese parameters provide different types of information that animals might potentially use for navigation. Intensity varies systematically with latitude and can provide positional information, while inclination also varies predictably with latitude and could serve as a magnetic latitude indicator. Declination provides information about magnetic versus geographic north, potentially useful for compass orientation.",

    "section": "2.3 4. Spatial and Temporal Variation",
    "text": "2.3 4. Spatial and Temporal Variation\n\n2.3.1 Global Spatial Patterns\nIntensity: The total magnetic field intensity shows global patterns that reflects the underlying dipolar structure of the core field. At the magnetic equators, where the field lines run horizontally, the total intensity reaches its minimum values of approximately 23,000 nanoTesla. Moving toward higher magnetic latitudes, the field intensity gradually increases as the field lines become more vertical, reaching maximum values of approximately 62,000 nanoTesla near the magnetic poles.\nThis variation in intensity with magnetic latitude creates what researchers term “isodynamic lines” - contours of equal magnetic intensity that generally run east-west but show considerable deviation from simple latitudinal bands due to non-dipolar components of the field. These intensity gradients are steep enough that animals traveling north-south distances of hundreds of kilometers would encounter measurable changes in field intensity.\nInclination: Magnetic inclination, the angle at which field lines plunge into Earth, provides perhaps the most systematic navigational cue available from the geomagnetic field. At the magnetic equator, field lines run horizontally, giving inclination values near zero degrees. Moving toward the magnetic poles, inclination increases progressively, reaching 90 degrees (vertical) at the magnetic poles themselves.\nThis relationship between inclination and magnetic latitude has led researchers to propose that inclination serves as a primary magnetic coordinate for animal navigation. The inclination gradient is steep enough that latitudinal movements of tens of kilometers produce detectable changes in inclination angle, potentially providing fine-scale positional information.\nDeclination: Magnetic declination on the other side, the deviation of magnetic north from geographic north, shows the most complex spatial patterns of the major magnetic field components. Unlike intensity and inclination, declination does not follow simple latitudinal patterns but instead shows regional variations that reflect the non-dipolar components of the core field and crustal magnetic anomalies.\nIn some regions, declination changes very gradually over large distances, while in other areas it can change by several degrees over distances of hundreds of kilometers. These declination patterns create distinctive regional magnetic signatures that could potentially serve as magnetic landmarks for animal navigation systems.\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Temporal Variations\nThe temporal behavior of Earth’s magnetic field spans an enormous range of time scales, from rapid variations lasting seconds to gradual changes occurring over geological time. Understanding these temporal variations is crucial for reading how animals use magnetic data for navigation.\nQuiet-Time Variations: Even during geomagnetically quiet periods, Earth’s magnetic field shows regular daily variations driven by solar heating of the ionosphere. During daylight hours, solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes atmospheric gases, creating electrical conductivity that allows current systems to flow in the ionosphere. These currents generate magnetic fields that add to the main field measured at Earth’s surface.\nThe amplitude of these quiet-time variations depends strongly on latitude and local time. At mid-latitudes, typical daily variations amount to approximately 20 nanoTesla, with maximum variations occurring during local noon when ionospheric currents are strongest. At polar latitudes, where ionospheric current systems are more complex, daily variations can reach 100 nanoTesla or more.\nThese regular variations follow predictable patterns that repeat daily and show seasonal modulations. For animals using magnetic cues for navigation, these predictable variations might either be filtered out by their sensory systems or potentially used as additional timing information.\nGeomagnetic Storm Disturbances: During periods of enhanced solar activity, Earth’s magnetic field can experience big disturbances that far exceed normal quiet-time variations. Geomagnetic storms occur when disturbances in the solar wind create enhanced coupling between the solar wind’s magnetic field and Earth’s magnetosphere. These events drive intense electrical currents in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, creating magnetic field variations that can exceed 1000 nanoTesla in polar regions and 250 nanoTesla at mid-latitudes²³.\nThe temporal characteristics of geomagnetic storms are particularly relevant for animal navigation. Storm-related magnetic field changes can occur within seconds to days, creating rapid alterations in the magnetic environment that animals experience. The magnitude of these changes often exceeds the established sensitivity thresholds of animal magnetoreceptors by factors of ten or more, suggesting that geomagnetic storms could significantly disrupt magnetic navigation systems.\nSecular Variation: On longer time scales, Earth’s magnetic field undergoes continuous slow changes known as secular variation, driven by evolving circulation patterns within the liquid outer core. These changes typically amount to tens of nanoTesla per year at any given location, representing a gradual evolution of the magnetic field over time scales of years to decades.\nFor long-lived migratory animals or populations with strong site fidelity, secular variation could potentially require periodic recalibration of magnetic navigation systems. However, the slow rate of secular variation means that it is unlikely to affect navigation during individual migratory journeys, which typically last weeks to months.",

    "text": "2.4 5. Geomagnetic Storms and Solar Wind\n\n2.4.1 Storm-Related Disruption\nThe sensitivity thresholds established by neurophysiological and behavioral research have profound implications when compared to the magnitude of magnetic field variations that occur during geomagnetic storms. Solar wind disturbances can create magnetic field changes exceeding 1000 nanoTesla within minutes during major geomagnetic storms²⁶, representing variations that are 5-65 times larger than established animal sensitivity thresholds.\nPotential Disruption Mechanisms: Animals using magnetic intensity as a positional cue could experience significant navigation errors during geomagnetic storms. If birds or other animals rely on specific intensity values as location markers, sudden storm-related intensity changes could create the illusion that they have been displaced to entirely different geographic locations. This effect would be similar to the responses observed in virtual magnetic displacement experiments¹⁵⁻¹⁶⁻¹⁷⁻²⁷, where animals exposed to artificial magnetic fields characteristic of distant locations attempt to compensate by changing their flight direction.\nAnimals using magnetic inclination or declination for compass orientation might experience disruption of their directional sensing capabilities during storms. Rapid changes in field direction could cause temporary loss of magnetic compass function, potentially forcing animals to rely on alternative compass systems such as solar or stellar compasses⁴.\nSpecies-Specific Responses: Different animal species likely respond to geomagnetic disturbances in various ways, depending on their particular methods of using magnetic information for navigation³. Some species might temporarily cease migration during severe magnetic disturbances, while others might switch to alternative navigation systems. The behavioral responses probably depend on the availability of backup navigation cues and the flexibility of each species’ navigation system.",

    "section": "2.5 6. Geomagnetic Data Sources",
    "text": "2.5 6. Geomagnetic Data Sources\n\n2.5.1 Terrestrial Observatory Networks\nThe systematic measurement of Earth’s magnetic field began in the 1830s and has evolved into a sophisticated global network of ground-based observatories that provide continuous, high-precision magnetic field measurements.\nINTERMAGNET Network: The International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) represents the primary source of ground-based geomagnetic data, currently comprising 152 observatories distributed across the globe³⁷. These observatories employ standardized instrumentation and data collection procedures to ensure consistency and comparability of measurements worldwide.\nEach INTERMAGNET observatory typically operates multiple magnetometers, including absolute instruments that measure the true magnetic field vector and variometers that detect changes in the field with high temporal resolution. The observatories record magnetic field measurements continuously, typically at one-second or one-minute intervals, creating detailed time series that capture both gradual changes and rapid fluctuations.\nAdvantages of Terrestrial Measurements: Ground-based observatories offer several significant advantages for magnetic field research. Their calibration accuracy is exceptionally high, with measurement uncertainties typically less than 1 nanoTesla for carefully maintained instruments. The continuous operation of these stations creates long-term data records, some extending back more than a century, that are invaluable for studying secular variation and long-term magnetic field changes.\nThe temporal resolution of ground-based measurements is also superior to satellite data, with one-second sampling rates that can capture rapid magnetic field fluctuations associated with geomagnetic storms and other space weather events. This high temporal resolution makes ground-based data particularly valuable for studying the detailed time evolution of magnetic disturbances.\nLimitations of Ground-Based Networks: Despite their high accuracy and temporal resolution, terrestrial magnetic observatories have significant limitations for global magnetic field studies. The spatial coverage is highly irregular, with dense networks in some regions (particularly northern and western Europe) but sparse or absent coverage in others. Oceanic regions are particularly poorly covered, with very few magnetic observatories on islands and none on the open ocean.\nThe effective spatial coverage of each observatory is limited to approximately 1000 kilometers, beyond which local magnetic variations can differ significantly from those measured at the observatory. This limitation means that only regions with dense observatory networks provide complete spatial coverage, excluding most animal migration pathways that cross oceanic or remote continental regions.\nTemporal data availability also presents challenges for real-time applications. Observatories submit their data to the central INTERMAGNET network at different times, often with delays of months to years for the highest quality, fully processed data. Some observatories occasionally cease operation due to funding or technical issues, creating gaps in temporal coverage.\n\n\n2.5.2 Satellite-Based Measurements\nSatellite missions have revolutionized geomagnetic field research by providing consistent global coverage with standardized instrumentation. Over the past 60 years, a series of dedicated magnetic field missions has complemented terrestrial measurements and enabled global-scale studies of magnetic field structure and dynamics.\nHistorical Satellite Missions: The evolution of satellite-based geomagnetism began with early missions such as POGO (1965-1971), which provided the first global magnetic field measurements from space. Subsequent missions including Magsat (1979-80), Ørsted (1999-present), CHAMP (2000-2010), and SAC-C (2000-present) progressively improved measurement accuracy and global coverage³⁸.\nEach mission contributed unique capabilities and extended the temporal baseline of satellite magnetic measurements. Magsat provided the first high-precision global magnetic field model, while Ørsted began the era of continuous, long-term satellite magnetic monitoring. CHAMP delivered exceptionally precise measurements that advanced understanding of both the main field and its temporal variations.\nThe Swarm Mission: The European Space Agency’s Swarm mission, launched in 2013, represents the current state-of-the-art in satellite-based magnetic field measurement³⁹. The mission employs three identical satellites arranged in a carefully designed constellation that provides enhanced spatial and temporal sampling of the global magnetic field.\nThe constellation consists of satellites Alpha and Charlie, which orbit in parallel at an altitude of 480 kilometers with a separation of approximately 150 kilometers at the equator. Satellite Bravo orbits at a higher altitude of 510 kilometers in a different orbital plane that, at present, is nearly perpendicular to the Alpha-Charlie pair. This configuration provides measurements at two different altitudes and enables separation of different magnetic field sources.\nSwarm Instrumentation: Each Swarm satellite carries identical scientific instrumentation designed for precise magnetic field measurement. The primary instruments include an Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) that measures the total magnetic field intensity, a Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM) that measures the three-component magnetic field vector, and a GPS receiver for precise orbit determination.\nThe VFM provides magnetic field measurements at 1 Hz resolution in the North-East-Centre coordinate system, calibrated using measurements from the ASM and stellar cameras that determine satellite orientation. This combination of instruments enables precise determination of both the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field vector at satellite altitude.\nAdvantages of Satellite Measurements: Satellite measurements resolve many of the limitations of ground-based networks by providing consistent global coverage with standardized instrumentation. The polar-orbiting design of most magnetic field satellites ensures complete global coverage within a few days, including oceanic and remote continental regions that lack ground-based observatories.\nSatellite data are typically available within days to weeks of collection, much faster than the fully processed data from many ground-based observatories. The standardized instrumentation and data processing procedures also ensure consistency in measurements across different geographic regions and time periods.\nThe orbital perspective of satellites enables measurement of the magnetic field above most ionospheric current systems, providing information about magnetic field sources that cannot be obtained from ground-based measurements alone. This capability is particularly valuable for studying external field variations and their global patterns.\nSatellite Data Access and Formats: Swarm data are made freely available through the European Space Agency’s Earth Observation Policy, with data access provided through the VirES (Virtual workspace for Earth observation Scientists) web platform⁴⁸. The Level 1b data products provide corrected and calibrated magnetic field measurements in standard scientific formats.\nHowever, satellite magnetic data are provided in specialized formats such as the Common Data Format (CDF) developed by NASA⁴³, which are not readily accessible using standard ecological data analysis software. This technical barrier has historically limited the use of satellite magnetic data outside the specialized geophysics community, despite the open data policies of space agencies.\n\n\n2.5.3 Geomagnetic Indices and Activity Monitoring\nUnderstanding and quantifying the level of geomagnetic activity is crucial for both space weather applications and studies of magnetic field effects on biological systems. Geomagnetic indices provide standardized measures of magnetic field disturbance that enable comparison of activity levels across different times and locations.\nK-Index System: The K-index represents the fundamental unit for measuring local geomagnetic disturbance. Calculated every three hours at individual magnetic observatories, the K-index quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of the magnetic field on a quasi-logarithmic scale from 0 to 9²⁶. A K-index of 0 indicates perfectly calm magnetic conditions, while values of 5 or higher indicate geomagnetic storm conditions.\nThe K-index calculation involves comparing the observed magnetic field variations during each three-hour period to the expected quiet-day variation for that location and season. This approach accounts for the regular daily variations in the magnetic field and highlights unusual disturbances that exceed normal quiet-time levels.\nKp Index: The planetary Kp index provides a global measure of geomagnetic activity by averaging K-indices from a standardized network of magnetic observatories distributed worldwide³⁵. Calculated every three hours, the Kp index ranges from 0 to 9 and serves as a proxy for the energy input from the solar wind into Earth’s magnetosphere.\nThe Kp index is widely used in space weather applications and research studies because it provides a single number that characterizes global magnetic activity levels. Kp values of 5 or higher indicate geomagnetic storm conditions, with values above 7 representing severe storms that can have significant technological and potentially biological impacts.",

This function is the annotation process per se, and through this process at first we run the interpolation getting the magnetic values in NEC reference frame and then we compute the extra magnetic values that are useful to get a better understating of the earth’s magnetic field at this particular location, date and time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📘 Auxiliary Functions:The function ST_IDW_Process includes 4 auxiliary functions to run the spatial-temporal kernel\n\n\ndistance_to_GPS function: Is the function in charge to calculate the distance between each GPS Point and the Swarm Point.\n\n\nKradius function: Is the function in charge to compute the R (radius) value in the cylinder. The R value will be considered based on the latitude of each GPS Point.\n\n\nDistJ function: This function will calculate the d value as the hypotenuse created in the triangle created amount the locations of the GPS point, the location of the Swarm points and the radius value.\n\n\nDfTime_func function: This is a time function to selected the points in the range of a the DeltaTime - DT window. The Delta time window has been set as 4 hours for each satellite trajectory.",

This version is called Sequential Mode, alternatively you can use Parallel Mode to take advantage of parallelized computing if required. More information about the Swarm satellites can be found in the Main Document on the MagGeo github repository. This script will use a sequential loop to run the annotation process for each GPS Point (row) from your data.\nTo execute the code, you can go through each cell (pressing Crtl+Enter), you will also find inner comments ## to describe each particular step. If you are not familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks, you might want to take some time to learn how first, for example take a look at the notebook-basics.ipynb Notebook inside MagGeo.",

We suggest that the Timestamp column follow the day/month/year Hour:Minute (dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM:SS) format, Latitude and Longitude should be in decimal degrees (WGS84). Optionally an altitude column can be used providing altitude (the altitude must be in km). Other Columns will be ignored. Here it is an example of how your GPS track should look:\n\nFor this example we are reading the BirdGPSTrajectory.csv file.

    "text": "4.9 Spatio-Temporal filter and Interpolation process (ST-IDW)\nOnce we have requested the swarm data, now we need to filter in space and time the available points to compute the magnetic values (NEC frame) for each GPS point based on its particular date and time. The function ST_IDW_Process imported in the row_handler, takes the GPS track and the downloaded data from swarm to filter in space and time based on the criteria defined in our method. With the swarm data filtered we interpolated (IDW) the NEC components for each GPS data point, based on the latitude, date, time and number of Swarm points filtered.\nThe function CHAOS_ground_values, inside the MagGeoFunctions file, is used to run the Calculation of magnetic components. This calculation requeries the magnetic components at the trajectory altitude (or at the ground level) using CHAOS (theta, phi, radial). This process include a rotation and transformation between a geocentric frame (CHAOS) and geodetic frame (GPS track). Once the corrected values are calculated, are included in the GPS track, and the non-necesary columns are removed. For more information about this process go to the Main Notebook.\n\n4.9.1 Run the (ST-IDW) process in parallel mode\nAlthough the next cell seems to run a small main function. What is happening is a call for several functions running at same time for several cores. Initially we set a pool of processes. Using the pool class we will distribute the assigned function among the data chucks we created. Every data chunk will be like a subset of the entire GPS track. So we need to iterate among data chunk. And inside every data chunk we need to identify the datetime, epoch, altitude, latitude and longitude of each row to run the interpolation & annotation process using the Swarm data we have filtered and stored in the previous steps.\nThe function in charge to distribute the required function (row_handler) among the data chunks is the map function from the pool class.\nrow_handler.py is an interows iteration to get the required parameter for the ST_IDW_Process function.\n\n📘 Auxiliary Functions:\n\n\nST_IDW_Process function: This is the main function in charge to read the Swarm Data already filtered, and then import DfTime_func, distance_to_GPS, Kradius , DistJ functions to compute the spatial-time cylinder and the annotation process. The return of this function is a row (dictionary) that will be appended into a python list where all the results from the different cores. The python list from every process is concatenated into a pandas dataframe in the main function having there the whole chain of the parallel process.\n\n\ndistance_to_GPS function: Is the function in charge to calculate the distance between each GPS Point and the Swarm Point.\n\n\nKradius function: Is the function in charge to compute the R (radius) value in the cylinder. The R value will be considered based on the latitude of each GPS Point.\n\n\nDistJ function: This function will calculate the d value as the hypotenuse created in the triangle created amount the locations of the GPS point, the location of the Swarm points and the radius value.\n\n\nDfTime_func function: This is a time function to selected the points in the range of a the DeltaTime - DT window. The Delta time window has been set as 4 hours for each satellite trajectory.\n\n\nCHAOS_ground_values function: This is the calculation of geomagnetic components function to get the CHAOS magnetic values and process the Nres,Eres,Cres values and transform them into the N,E,C values at the GPS altitude.\n\n\n\n\n%%time\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom utilities.row_handler import row_handler\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with multiprocessing.Pool(NumCores) as pool:\n        GeoMagParallelResult = pd.concat(pool.map(partial(row_handler),df_chunks), ignore_index=True)\n\nAnnotating the GPS Trayectory: 100%|██████████| 12/12 [00:00&lt;00:00, 18.64it/s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU times: user 245 ms, sys: 265 ms, total: 510 ms\nWall time: 17.5 s\n\n\nWith the Parallel mode the Annotation process takes about 12 seconds to complete ( We had tested the parallel process in a windows server machine with 12 cores, see the image bellow). With the same GPS track in the sequetial mode the process is complete in about 2 minutes. In the image bellow you can see how the machine create several python processes and all cores (full CPU capacity) is taken.\n\n🔈 Multiprocessing:\nis even more powerfull when you have to process a big amount of data (e.g. 2 millons of points). Although here is making a notable improvement if you have to process a big dataset the parallelization makes even more sense.\nBe aware that there is no output cell in here, you can follow the parallelization progress in the Anaconda Prompt.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nWith Python and in particular with many new ways to use your computer, create folder and scripts things can get messy and very confusing, this is very normal and it is part of the process. The first thing is do not get frustrated or trying all sort of things without understanding what is the root of the issue. So you need to think systematically and then find out the solution. Here I have listed a few potential and common issues you might find. So first take all of this before escalating your issue to the lecturer or the IT support team.\n\n\n\nBefore Seeking Help\nYou should complete this checklist:\n\nMiniconda is installed and conda --version works\nEnvironment was created without errors\nEnvironment shows (maggeo) when activated\nVerification script runs successfully\nJupyter Lab starts without errors\n\n\n\nStandardized Error Reporting\nWhen reporting problems, always include:\n# Run these commands and include output\nconda info\nconda list geopandas\npython --version\njupyter --version\n\n\n\nIssue 1: “conda: command not found”\nThis is the most common issue for beginners.\nWindows Solution:\n# Option 1: Use the correct command prompt\n# Search for \"Anaconda Prompt\" in Start Menu if available\n# Or reinstall Miniconda ensuring PATH is added\n\n# Option 2: Manually add to PATH\nset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\miniconda3\\Scripts\nset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\miniconda3\nmacOS Solution:\n# Add to PATH temporarily\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Add to PATH permanently\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n# For zsh users (macOS Catalina and later)\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n\nIssue 2: Environment Creation Fails\nCommon causes and solutions:\n# Solution 1: Clean conda cache\nconda clean --all\n\n# Solution 2: Update conda first\nconda update conda\n\n# Solution 3: Try creating environment with explicit solver\nconda env create -f environment.yml --solver=classic\n\n# Solution 4: Check internet connection and try again\n# Large downloads may timeout on slow connections\n\n\nIssue 3: Different Python Versions\nAll students must have Python 3.10 for consistency.\n# Check your Python version\npython --version\n\n# If incorrect, remove environment and recreate\nconda env remove --name maggeo\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n\nIssue 4: Package Conflicts During Installation\nThis indicates environment file issues:\n# Solution: Use mamba for faster, more reliable solving\nconda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge\nmamba env create -f environment.yml\n\n\nIssue 5: Jupyter Lab Won’t Start\nConsistency check:\n# Ensure environment is activated\nconda activate maggeo\n\n# Verify Jupyter installation\njupyter --version\n\n# If missing, reinstall\nconda install jupyter jupyterlab -c conda-forge\n\n# Start Jupyter Lab\njupyter lab\n\n\nIssue 6: Import Errors Despite Successful Installation\nEnvironment activation problem:\n# Always activate environment first\nconda activate maggeo\n\n# Check which Python you're using\nwhich python     # macOS/Linux\nwhere python     # Windows\n\n# Should show path to conda environment, not system Python\n\n\nEmergency Reinstallation\nIf all else fails, sometimes it is better and quicker run a complete clean installation:\n# Remove environment\nconda env remove --name maggeo\n\n# Clean all caches\nconda clean --all\n\n# Recreate environment\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\nUse the following instructions as a guide for extra resources and better familiarity with working with Python. In case you want to manage your python environment, export your outcomes to PDF, and get extra learning resources.\n\nEnvironment Management - Useful Commands\n# List all environments\nconda env list\n\n# Activate environment\nconda activate maggeo\n\n# Deactivate environment\nconda deactivate\n\n# Update all packages in environment\nconda update --all\n\n# Install additional package\nconda install package-name\n\n# Remove environment\nconda env remove --name maggeo\n\n\nUpdating the Environment\n# Update environment from file\nconda env update -f environment.yml --prune\n\n\nExporting Your Environment\n# Export current environment\nconda env export &gt; my-environment.yml",
