# Installing MagGeo {.unnumbered}

MagGeo is a specialized tool that helps researchers analyze magnetic field data in relation to animal movement patterns. This guide will walk you through installing MagGeo on your computer, even if you're more familiar with R than Python.

## What You'll Need

Before we begin, understand that **MagGeo** is currently built using Python (similar to how some R packages depend on specific R versions). We'll set up a contained environment so it won't interfere with any existing R installations or other software on your computer.

## Step 1: Install Miniconda (Your Python Environment Manager)

**What is Miniconda?** Think of Miniconda as a package manager for Python, similar to how CRAN manages R packages. It creates isolated environments so different projects don't conflict with each other.

### For Windows Users:

1.  Visit <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>
2.  Download the "Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit" installer
3.  Run the downloaded `.exe` file as administrator
4.  Follow the installation wizard:
    -   Accept the license agreement
    -   Choose "Just Me" installation
    -   Use the default installation location
    -   **Important:** Check "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable" (even if it shows a warning)
5.  Click "Install" and wait for completion

### For macOS Users:

1.  Visit <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>
2.  Download the "Miniconda3 macOS 64-bit pkg" installer
3.  Double-click the downloaded `.pkg` file
4.  Follow the installation wizard using default settings
5.  The installer will automatically add conda to your PATH

**Verification:** After installation, open a new terminal (macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and type `conda --version`. You should see a version number.

## Step 2: Clone MagGeo

You will need to clone the MagGeo repository in your local computer (we are currently working to make make MagGeo available in `pip` to an easier installation), for now simply clone it and you will have access to all MagGeo.

If you don't have **Git**, or you are not use to work with version control, you will need to install git to clone any repository from GitHub

## Installing Git

**What is Git?** Git is like a sophisticated "track changes" system for code, similar to version control in collaborative documents. We need it to download the MagGeo software.

### For Windows Users:

1.  Visit <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
2.  Download "Git for Windows"
3.  Run the installer with these recommended settings:
    -   Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt"
    -   Choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
    -   Use all other default settings

### For macOS Users:

**Option A (Recommended):**

1\. Open Terminal (found in Applications \> Utilities)

2\. Type `git --version` and press Enter

3\. If **Git** isn't installed, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools

4\. Click "Install" and follow the prompts

**Option B:**

1\. Visit <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

2\. Download "Git for macOS"

3\. Run the installer with default settings
:::

### For Both Windows and macOS Users:

1.  **Open your command line interface:**

    -   **Windows:** Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
    -   **macOS:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter

2.  **Navigate to your desired location** (optional but recommended):

    ``` bash
    # Windows users:
    cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents

    # macOS users:
    cd ~/Documents
    ```

3.  **Download MagGeo:**

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/MagGeo/MagGeo-Annotation-Program.git
    ```

    This creates a folder called "**MagGeo-Annotation-Program**" with all the necessary files.

## Step 4: Navigate to the MagGeo Folder

``` bash
cd MagGeo-Annotation-Program
```

## Step 5: Create the MagGeo Environment

This creates a specialized Python environment with all the specific packages MagGeo needs, similar to installing a comprehensive R package with all its dependencies.

``` bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

::: callout-warning
**This process will take 5-10 minutes** as it downloads and installs all required components. You'll see progress messages - this is normal.
:::

## Step 6: Activate the MagGeo Environment

Every time you want to use MagGeo, you'll need to "activate" its environment first:

``` bash
conda activate MagGeoEnv
```

**What this does:** Switches your command line to use the MagGeo-specific Python environment, ensuring all the right tools are available.

## Step 7: Set Up VirES Access (Magnetic Field Data)

**What is VirES?** VirES provides access to satellite magnetic field data from ESA's Swarm mission. Think of it as a specialized database for magnetic field measurements that MagGeo uses to understand the magnetic environment your animals experienced.

**MagGeo** use [**VirES**](https://swarm-vre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swarm_notebooks/02a__Intro-Swarm-viresclient.html) (Virtual environments for Earth Scientists) a platform for data & model access, analysis, and visualization for ESAâ€™s magnetic mission **Swarm**. This is a powerful client with the [viresclient API](https://swarm-vre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Swarm_notebooks/02c__viresclient-API.html) that provide several classes and methods defined in the vires client package. The `viresclient` Python package allows you to connect to the VirES server to download [Swarm](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/swarm) data and data calculated using magnetic models.

### Create Your VirES Account:

1.  **Sign up:** Visit <https://vires.services/oauth/accounts/signup/>

    -   Use your institutional email if possible
    -   Create a secure password
    -   Verify your email address

2.  **Log in:** Go to <https://vires.services/>

3.  **Get your access token:**

    -   Follow the detailed instructions at <https://viresclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_token.html>
    -   Your token is like a password that allows MagGeo to download data for you
    -   **Important:** Keep this token secure and don't share it

4.  **Configure MagGeo with your token:**

    ``` bash
    # Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token
    viresclient set_token --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
    ```

## Testing Your Installation

To verify everything is working:

1.  Make sure you're in the MagGeo directory and the environment is activated
2.  Try running a simple test (specific commands will depend on MagGeo's documentation)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Problem:** "conda is not recognized as an internal or external command"

-   **Solution:** Miniconda wasn't added to PATH during installation

-   **Fix:** Reinstall Miniconda and ensure you check "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable"

**Problem:** "Permission denied" errors

-   **Solution:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator

-   **Fix:** Right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator"

**Problem:** Long path names causing issues

-   **Solution:** Install MagGeo in a shorter path like `C:\MagGeo`

### macOS-Specific Issues

**Problem:** "command not found: conda"

-   **Solution:** Terminal doesn't recognize conda

-   **Fix:** Close and reopen Terminal, or run `source ~/.bash_profile`

**Problem:** "Permission denied" during Git clone

-   **Solution:** You don't have write permissions in the current directory -

-   **Fix:** Navigate to your home directory first: `cd ~`

**Problem:** Xcode Command Line Tools installation fails

-   **Solution:** Install Xcode from the App Store first, then try again

### General Issues

**Problem:** Environment creation fails with package conflicts

-   **Solution:** Clear conda cache and try again

-   **Fix:** Clean your conda enviroment cache and reinstall the MagGeo environment.

```         
`conda clean --all`

`conda env create --file environment.yml`
```

**Problem:** VirES token authentication fails

-   **Solution:** Token might be incorrect or expired

-   **Fix:** Generate a new token from the VirES website and reconfigure

**Problem:** Git clone fails with "Repository not found"

-   **Solution:** Check your internet connection and the repository URL

-   **Fix:** Try cloning again, or download the ZIP file directly from GitHub
