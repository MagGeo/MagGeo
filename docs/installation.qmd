You will need to change the directory to where you cloned/downloaded the MagGeo repository. If you donwloaded it--Do not forget to unzip the folder before using it.
If you're using the terminal on Linux or macOS, it is the same syntax to change directory.

```bash
cd MagGeo-Annotation-Program
```

## 4. Create MagGeoEnv environment  -- this should take around five minutes.
