# Data requirements {.unnumbered}

::: callout-important
ðŸ”Ž Your trajectory must be in a csv format:

There are three columns that must be included in your GPS trajectory. Make sure your GPS trajectory includes **Latitude** , **Longitude** and **timestamp**. We suggest that the Timestamp column follow the day/month/year Hour:Minute (**dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM:SS**) format, Latitude and Longitude should be in decimal degrees (WGS84). If you have a **altitude** attribute, make sure that the units are in kilometers. Other columns will be ignored. Here it is an example of how your GPS track should looks like.

For this example we are reading the **BirdGPSTrajectory.csv** file. If you want to run the method using your own csv file, make sure you store your the file in the `/data` folder. For more information about the dataset we used in this example go to the Main Notebook.

# Dataset used as use-case

MagGeo comes with a dataset for the use case you see in the notebook outputs. This dataset comes from the MoveBank Data Repository (https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/)\[1\]\[2\].

We annotated tracking data of greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), which migrate between northern Germany and the Russian Arctic. We annotated data for fifteen individuals in a single autumn migration (42 days) a total of 973 GPS location.
