# Troubleshooting Guide {.unnumbered}

::: callout-note
With Python and in particular with many new ways to use your computer, create folder and scripts things can get messy and very confusing, this is very normal and it is part of the process. The first thing is do not get frustrated or trying all sort of things without understanding what is the root of the issue. So you need to think systematically and then find out the solution. Here I have listed a few potential and common issues you might find. So first take all of this before escalating your issue to the lecturer or the IT support team.

### Before Seeking Help

**You should complete this checklist:**

-   [ ] Miniconda is installed and `conda --version` works
-   [ ] Environment was created without errors
-   [ ] Environment shows `(maggeo)` when activated
-   [ ] Verification script runs successfully
-   [ ] Jupyter Lab starts without errors

### Standardized Error Reporting

**When reporting problems, always include:**

``` bash
# Run these commands and include output
conda info
conda list geopandas
python --version
jupyter --version
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Issue 1: "conda: command not found"

**This is the most common issue for beginners.**

**Windows Solution**:

``` bash
# Option 1: Use the correct command prompt
# Search for "Anaconda Prompt" in Start Menu if available
# Or reinstall Miniconda ensuring PATH is added

# Option 2: Manually add to PATH
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\%USERNAME%\miniconda3\Scripts
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\%USERNAME%\miniconda3
```

**macOS Solution**:

``` bash
# Add to PATH temporarily
export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

# Add to PATH permanently
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# For zsh users (macOS Catalina and later)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue 2: Environment Creation Fails

**Common causes and solutions:**

``` bash
# Solution 1: Clean conda cache
conda clean --all

# Solution 2: Update conda first
conda update conda

# Solution 3: Try creating environment with explicit solver
conda env create -f environment.yml --solver=classic

# Solution 4: Check internet connection and try again
# Large downloads may timeout on slow connections
```

### Issue 3: Different Python Versions

**All students must have Python 3.10 for consistency.**

``` bash
# Check your Python version
python --version

# If incorrect, remove environment and recreate
conda env remove --name maggeo
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Issue 4: Package Conflicts During Installation

**This indicates environment file issues:**

``` bash
# Solution: Use mamba for faster, more reliable solving
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

### Issue 5: Jupyter Lab Won't Start

**Consistency check:**

``` bash
# Ensure environment is activated
conda activate maggeo

# Verify Jupyter installation
jupyter --version

# If missing, reinstall
conda install jupyter jupyterlab -c conda-forge

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### Issue 6: Import Errors Despite Successful Installation

**Environment activation problem:**

``` bash
# Always activate environment first
conda activate maggeo

# Check which Python you're using
which python     # macOS/Linux
where python     # Windows

# Should show path to conda environment, not system Python
```

### Emergency Reinstallation

**If all else fails, sometimes it is better and quicker run a complete clean installation:**

``` bash
# Remove environment
conda env remove --name maggeo

# Clean all caches
conda clean --all

# Recreate environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Additional Resources

Use the following instructions as a guide for extra resources and better familiarity with working with Python. In case you want to manage your python environment, export your outcomes to PDF, and get extra learning resources.

### Environment Management - Useful Commands {#environment-management}

``` bash
# List all environments
conda env list

# Activate environment
conda activate maggeo

# Deactivate environment
conda deactivate

# Update all packages in environment
conda update --all

# Install additional package
conda install package-name

# Remove environment
conda env remove --name maggeo
```

### Updating the Environment

``` bash
# Update environment from file
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

### Exporting Your Environment

``` bash
# Export current environment
conda env export > my-environment.yml
```
