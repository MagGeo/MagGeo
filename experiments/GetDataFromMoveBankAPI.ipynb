    "For more information about how to properly request the data using the MoveBank API, please visit (https://github.com/movebank/movebank-api-doc/blob/master/movebank-api.md). It is better for you to get familiar first with the way the data is requested, what attributes are avaliable and more importantly if the study you are looking for is open accesisable ( No username or pass is requiered) or you need to add your Movebank credentials to get access. You might also need to check what the API is returning checking the Individuals, Events and Studies URL requests."

It contains animal tracking data collected for the project/study H_GRONINGEN, using trackers developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl). The study was operational from 2012 until 2018. In total 4 individuals of Western marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus) have been tagged in their breeding area in the province Groningen (the Netherlands) close to the Netherlands-Germany border, mainly to study their habitat use and migration behaviour. Data from active or new trackers are periodically uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank (see https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking) and then Zenodo, but for this study none of the tracked birds have been observed in the vicinity of their known breeding grounds (and thus data retrieval points) since 2018. See Milotic et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.947.52570) for a more detailed description of this dataset.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The degradation of critical wintering and migratory stop-over sites is known to have direct consequences on the survival and reproductive condition of migratory shorebirds. However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. \\n\\nThe primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of American Golden-Plovers during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. \\n\\nIn 2018 and 2019, we equipped 47 American Golden-Plovers at 8 Arctic-breeding locations (Utqiagvik, Prudhoe Bay, Nome, Katakturuk, Bylot Island, Igloolik, Cambridge Bay, and East Bay) with 4.8 g Pinpoint GPS ARGOS tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every 2 days beginning on 20 June.  This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA). However, please do not use this information without first consulting the authors. \",\n",

We used state\\u2010of\\u2010art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3\\u201014% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Populations of soaring birds are often impacted by wind-power generation. Sex and age bias in turbine collisions can exacerbate these impacts through demographic changes that can lead to population decline or collapse. While several studies have reported sex and age differences in the number of soaring birds killed by turbines, it remains unclear if they result from different abundances or group-specific turbine avoidance behaviours, the latter having severer consequences. We investigated sex and age effects on turbine avoidance behaviour of black kites (Milvus migrans) during migration near the Strait of Gibraltar. We tracked the movements of 135 individuals with GPS data loggers in an area with high density of turbines and then modelled the effect of proximity of turbines on bird utilization distribution (UD). Both sexes and age classes showed similar patterns of displacement, with reduced UD values in the proximity of turbines and a clear peak at 700\\u2013850 m away, probably marking the distance at which most birds turn direction to avoid approaching the turbines further. The consistency of these patterns indicates that displacement range can be used as an accurate proxy for collision risk and habitat loss, and should be incorporated in environmental impact assessment studies.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The dynamic environmental conditions in highly seasonal systems likely have a strong influence on how species use the landscape. Animals must balance seasonal and daily changes to landscape risk with the underlying resources provided by that landscape. One way to balance the seasonal and daily changes in the costs and benefits of a landscape is through behaviorally-explicit resource selection and temporal partitioning. Here, we test whether resource selection of coyotes (Canis latrans) in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada is behaviorally-explicit and responsive to the daily and seasonal variation to presumed costs and benefits of moving on the landscape. We used GPS data and local convex hulls to estimate space use and Hidden Markov Models to estimate three types of movement behavior: encamped, foraging, and traveling. We then used integrated step-selection analysis to investigate behaviorally explicit resource selection across times of day (diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal) and season (snow-free and snow). We found that throughout the day and seasonally coyotes shifted foraging behavior and altered behavior and resource choices to avoid moving across what we could be a challenging landscape. These changes in behavior suggest that coyotes have a complex response to land cover, terrain, and linear corridors that are not only scale dependent but also vary by behavior, diel period, and season. By examining the resource selection across three axes (behavior, time of day, and season), we have a more nuanced understanding of how a predator balances the cost and benefits of a stochastic environment.\",\n",

We thus can assess the role of local odours at the release site as well as the role of environmental odours perceived on the way, far from the release site. We observed that pigeons transported and kept at the release site in purified air and made anosmic at the release site were unable to orient towards home and were impaired at homing. By contrast, pigeons allowed to smell environmental odours during transportation and at the release site, although made anosmic prior to release, displayed unimpaired homeward orientation, but nevertheless showed impaired homing performance. These results are consistent with the view that local odour at the release site are critical for determining the direction of displacement (olfactory map) and suggest that pigeons consult the olfactory map also during their homing flight in order to be able to find their way home.\",\n",

We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in lesser black-backed gulls breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10\\u201319 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. Lesser black-backed gulls foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0.5\\u201326.4 h (mean 8.7 h), and ranges varied from 3.0\\u201379.9 km (mean 30.9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7.5\\u2013333.6 km (mean 97.9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48%), insects (38%), fish (28%), litter (26%) and earthworms (20%). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland. The flight patterns of lesser black-backed gulls at sea overlapped with fishing-vessel distribution, including small beam trawlers fishing for shrimps in coastal waters close to the colony and large beam-trawlers fishing for flatfish at greater distances. Our data show that individuals made intensive use of the anthropogenic landscape and seascape, indicating that lesser black-backed gulls are not a predominantly marine species during the incubation period.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Individual foraging site fidelity, whereby individuals repeatedly visit the same foraging\\nareas, is widespread in nature, and likely benefits individuals through higher foraging\\nefficiency and potentially, higher breeding success. It may arise as a consequence of\\nhabitat or resource specialisation, or alternatively, where resources are abundant or\\npredictable, the partitioning of space might guarantee individuals exclusive foraging\\nopportunities. We tracked seven adult great black-backed gulls Larus marinus at a\\nNorth Sea colony from early incubation to the end of the breeding season in 2016,\\nproviding a total of 1170 foraging trips over a mean \\u00b1 SD tracking period of 67 \\u00b1 16\\ndays. There was clear spatial segregation between individuals, with almost no overlap\\nof their core areas (50% utilisation distribution) during incubation and chickrearing.\\nCore areas were relatively small and there was high repeatability (R \\u00b1 SE) in\\nforaging parameters, including initial departure direction (0.73 \\u00b1 0.11), foraging range\\n(0.41 \\u00b1 0.14) and cumulative distance travelled (0.19 \\u00b1 0.1) throughout the breeding\\nseason. Despite the low spatial overlap, there was little evidence of differential habitat\\nuse by individuals. The near-exclusive individual foraging areas of this species, usually\\nconsidered to be a generalist, indicate that where there is high resource availability\\nthroughout the breeding season and a small local population, individuals appear to\\nadopt a territorial strategy which likely reduces intraspecific competition.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Due to a long running research bias towards the breeding season, there are major gaps in knowledge on the basic nonbreeding ecology of many species, preventing a full annual cycle focus in ecology and conservation. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many species are extremely difficult to detect outside of breeding. Here, we demonstrate a partial solution to this problem by using archival GPS tags to examine the overwintering ecology of a migratory nocturnal bird, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferous). We deployed tags on 21 individuals and were able to recover 11 (52%) one year later. Tags collected high precision (approx. 10m) points throughout the nonbreeding period. With continuous time movement models, we used these data to estimate overwintering home ranges. All individuals exhibited at least one bounded home range during this phase of the annual cycle, three of eleven had two wintering locations, and home range area ranged from 0.50\\u201310.85ha. All overwintering home ranges contained closed-canopy forest land cover (42-100%), and no other land cover type represented >40% of any home range.  We found some evidence, with caveats, that total edge within the landscape surrounding the home range was negatively related to home range area. The prevalence of contiguous closed-canopy forest cover in overwintering home ranges contrasts with apparent breeding habitat preferences, which includes clear cuts and other, more open, habitats. This study is the first to reveal key aspects of overwintering space use in this species by using archival GPS to overcome both logistical and methodological limitations. Expanded use of such technology is critical to gathering basic ecological and distributional data, necessary for achieving a more complete understanding of full annual cycles of animal populations.\",\n",

Aspects of spatial memory and perception likely combine to support the now well-documented ability of homing pigeons to learn to retrace the same route when homing from familiar locations, leading to the prediction that damage to the HF would result in a diminished ability to repeatedly fly a similar route home. HF-lesioned homing pigeons were repeatedly released from three sites to assess the importance of the hippocampus as pigeons gradually learn a familiar route home guided by familiar landmark and landscape features. As expected, control pigeons displayed increasing fidelity to a familiar route home, and by inference, successful perceptual and memory processing of familiar landmarks/landscape features. By contrast, the impoverished route fidelity of the HF-lesioned pigeons indicated an impaired sensitivity to the same landmark/landscape features.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"One popular way to manage herbivorous waterfowl species foraging on farmland is to scare birds off the land, often in association with shooting. However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We measured flight durations of the white-fronted goose, the most common (grass-eating) species wintering in western Europe, by high-frequency accelerometer recordings and made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances.\\nOn average, the geese flew daily 2 \\u00d7 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m), and furthermore took to the air 5.3 times during a day (and 1.9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0.6 h day-1 and a total foraging time of 7.4 h day-1. With an intentional disturbance rate e.g. of five times a day, the birds\\u2019 compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11.5\\u201316 % day-1. Accommodation schemes have to take such increases in total grass consumption into account when deciding on the refuge areas to be set aside.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Abstract: A large body of evidence has shown that anosmic pigeons are impaired in their navigation. However, the role of odours in navigation is still subject to debate. While according to the olfactory navigation hypothesis homing pigeons possess a navigational map based on the distribution of environmental odours, the olfactory activation hypothesis proposes that odour perception is only needed to activate a navigational mechanism based on cues of another nature. Here we tested experimentally whether the perception of artificial odours is sufficient to allow pigeons to navigate, as expected from the olfactory activation hypothesis. We transported three groups of pigeons in air-tight containers to release sites 53 and 61 km from home in three different olfactory conditions. The Control (C) group received natural environmental air; both the Pure Air (PA) and the Artificial Odour (AO) groups received pure air filtered through an active charcoal filter. Only the Artificial Odour group received additional puffs of artificial odours until release. We then released pigeons while recording their tracks with 1Hz GPS data loggers. We also followed non-homing pigeons using an aerial data readout to a Cessna plane, allowing, for the first time, the tracking of non-homing homing pigeons. Within the first hour after release, the pigeons in both the Artificial Odour and the Pure Air group (receiving no environmental odours) showed impaired navigational performances at each release site. Our data provide evidence against an activation role of odours in navigation, and document that pigeons only navigate well when they perceive environmental odours.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Organized flight of homing pigeons (Columba livia) was previously shown to rely on simple leadership rules between flock mates, yet the stability of this social structuring over time and across different contexts remains unclear. We quantified the repeatability of leadership-based flock structures within a flight and across multiple flights conducted with the same animals. We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring. Our study empirically demonstrates that leadership and followership are consistent behaviours in homing pigeon flocks, but such consistency is affected by the heterogeneity of individual flight experiences and/or age. Similar evidence from other species suggests leadership as an important mechanism for coordinated motion in small groups of animals with strong social bonds.\",\n",

Individuals left in the Middle East showing the species-specific migratory behavior. Apart of this individual, only some wild and semi-wild sedentary free-flying colonies and several zoo colonies are remaining. \\n\\nFor 10 years, the Waldrappteam and its partners particular aim is to preserve the NBI as a migratory species from extinction, by creating new Migration traditions with descendants of European Zoo-Populations. A first migratory colony could be established. The birds breed in Burghausen/Bavaria and winter in the WWF Oasi Laguna di Orbetello/Tuscany. \\n\\nIn 2014 a project, co-financed by the European Commission (LIFE+), starts. It aims to establish three migratory NBI colonies in Europe, with breeding areas north of the Alps and a common migration tradition to a wintering area in the southern Tuscany/Italy. \\n\\nAll birds are equipped with GPS tags. The major aim for tagging is to implement actions against illegal hunting in Italy, the major threat for the free-flying birds. Two birds are currently tagged with solar-tags provided by the MPIAB. Our aim for the near future is to publish the majority of track via Movebank. \\n\\nThe migration corridor ranges from Bavaria to the southern Tuscany, directly across the Alps and the Apennine. Major movements of adult birds along the migration corridor occur during the migration periods, which last from April till May (spring) resp. from August till October (autumn). Juvenile and sub-adult NBIs fly in the range of the migration corridor from April till October.  \",\n",

Birds\\u2019 site fidelity is constrained by both sea-ice conditions around the colony that limit movements and resources availability, and also behavioural repeatability of individuals driven by phenological constraints. Ad\\u00e9lie penguins favoured sea-ice concentrations between 20-30%, as these facilitate access to open water while opening multiple patches for exploration in restricted areas in case of prey depletion. When the sea-ice concentration became greater than 30%, foraging site fidelity decreased and showed higher variability, while it increased again after 60%. Between two trips, the foraging site fidelity remained high when sea-ice concentration changed by \\u00b1 10% but showed greater variability when sea-ice concentrations differed on a larger range.\\n\",\n",

It contains animal tracking data collected by the LifeWatch GPS tracking network for large birds (http://lifewatch.be/en/gps-tracking-network-large-birds) for the project/study HG_OOSTENDE, using trackers developed by the University of Amsterdam Bird Tracking System (UvA-BiTS, http://www.uva-bits.nl). The study has been operational since 2013. In total 60 individuals of European Herring gull (Larus argentatus) have been tagged in or near their breeding area at the southern North Sea coast (Ostend and Zeebrugge in Belgium), mainly to study their habitat use. Data from active or new trackers are periodically uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank (see https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking) and then Zenodo. An older version of this dataset has been described in Stienen et al. (2016, https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.555.6173).\",\n",

Overlap areas were calculated as dynamic Brownian bridges of stopover, nest and moulting sites.\\nResults: Utilisation areas of the two populations overlapped only somewhat during spring and autumn migration stopovers, but much during moult. During this stage, non-breeders and failed breeders of the North Sea population intermixed with geese from the Pannonic population in the Pyasina delta on Taimyr peninsula. The timing of use of overlap areas was highly consistent between populations, making exchange possible. Two of our tracked geese switched from the North Sea population flyway to the Pannonic flyway during moult on Taimyr peninsula or early during the subsequent autumn migration. Because we could follow one of them during the next year, where it stayed in the Pannonic flyway, we suggest that the exchange was long-term or permanent.

      "    \"study_objective\": \"According to migration theory and several empirical studies, long-distance migrants are more time-limited during spring migration and should therefore migrate faster in spring than in autumn. Competition for the best breeding sites is supposed to be the main driver, but timing of migration is often also influenced by environmental factors such as food availability and wind conditions. Using GPS tags, we tracked 65 greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons migrating between western Europe and the Russian Arctic during spring and autumn migration over six different years. Contrary to theory, our birds took considerably longer for spring migration (83 days) than autumn migration (42 days). This difference in duration was mainly determined by time spent at stopovers. Timing and space use during migration suggest that the birds were using different strategies in the two seasons: In spring they spread out in a wide front to acquire extra energy stores in many successive stopover sites (to fuel capital breeding), which is in accordance with previous results that white-fronted geese follow the green wave of spring growth. In autumn they filled up their stores close to the breeding grounds and waited for supportive wind conditions to quickly move to their wintering grounds. Selection for supportive winds was stronger in autumn, when general wind conditions were less favourable than in spring, leading to similar flight speeds in the two seasons. In combination with less stopover time in autumn this led to faster autumn than spring migration. White-fronted geese thus differ from theory that spring migration is faster than autumn migration. We expect our findings of different decision rules between the two migratory seasons to apply more generally, in particular in large birds in which capital breeding is common, and in birds that meet other environmental conditions along their migration route in autumn than in spring.

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Background: Departure decisions in long-distance migratory bird species may depend on favourable weather conditions and beneficial resources at the destination location, overarched by genetic triggers. However, few studies have tried to validate the significance of these three concepts simultaneously, and long-term, high-resolution tagging datasets recording individual movements across consecutive years are scarce. We used such a dataset to explore intraspecific and intra-individual variabilities in departure and arrival decisions from/to wintering grounds in relation to these three different concepts in bird migration.\\n\\nMethods: We equipped 23 curlews (Numenius arquata) wintering in the Wadden Sea with Global Positioning System data loggers to record their spatio-temporal patterns of departure from and arrival at their wintering site, and the first part of their spring migration. We obtained data for 42 migrations over 6 years, with 12 individuals performing repeat migrations in consecutive years. Day of year of departure and arrival was related to 38 meteorological and bird-related predictors using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify drivers of departure and arrival decisions.\\n\\nResults: Curlews migrated almost exclusively to Arctic and sub-Arctic Russia for breeding. They left their wintering site mainly during the evening from mid- to late April and returned between the end of June and mid-July. There was no difference in departure times between the sexes. Weather parameters did not impact departure decisions; if departure days coincided with headwind conditions, the birds accounted for this by flying at higher altitudes of up to several kilometres. Curlews breeding further away in areas with late snowmelt departed later. Departures dates varied by only <4 days in individual curlews tagged over consecutive years.\\n\\nConclusions: These results suggest that the trigger for migration in this long-distance migrant is largely independent of weather conditions but is subject to resource availability in breeding areas. The high intra-individual repeatability of departure days among subsequent years and the lack of relationship to weather parameters suggest the importance of genetic triggers in prompting the start of migration. Further insights into the timing of migration in immatures and closely related birds might help to further unravel the genetic mechanisms triggering migration patterns.\",\n",

The ability of fauna to persist in fragmented landscapes is influenced by their capacity to move and access important resources such as food, water and shelter. When resources are depleted and spatially heterogeneous, identifying high quality habitat patches and understanding how individuals move through the landscape is critical for effective faunal conservation and management.\\n\\nPhillip Island, located south of Australia, is a highly modified and fragmented landscape that contains patches of native vegetation amongst a matrix of agricultural farmland and urban developments. The island supports an abundant population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), but little is known about how individuals move through this landscape. \\nWe developed and tested an inexpensive custom-made GPS wildlife tracker that sends data via the mobile phone network. High-resolution movement data gained from the trackers enabled us to highlights features that facilitate movement and others that represent barriers. Further we modelled how wallabies select resources within the landscape and move both within and between patches. Information about movement patterns and resource selection generated by the analysis will inform and improve the management of swamp wallabies in human-modified and fragmented landscapes and more generally enhance our understanding of the challenges faced by fauna in changing environments worldwide.\\n\",\n",

Na\\u00efve marine animals use an inherited navigational map during migration but in inexperienced terrestrial animal migrants unequivocal evidence of navigation is lacking. We present satellite tracking data on common cuckoos experimentally displaced 1,800 km eastward from Rybachy to Kazan. After displacement, both young and adult travelled similarly towards the route of non-displaced control birds. The tracking data demonstrate the potential for young common cuckoos to return to the species-specific migration route after displacement, a response so far reported exclusively in experienced birds. Our results indicate that an inherited map allows first-time migrating cuckoos to locate suitable wintering grounds. This is in contrast to previous studies of solitary terrestrial bird migrants but similar to that reported from the marine environment.\",\n",

Overlap areas were calculated as dynamic Brownian bridges of stopover, nest and moulting sites.\\nResults: Utilisation areas of the two populations overlapped only somewhat during spring and autumn migration stopovers, but much during moult. During this stage, non-breeders and failed breeders of the North Sea population intermixed with geese from the Pannonic population in the Pyasina delta on Taimyr peninsula. The timing of use of overlap areas was highly consistent between populations, making exchange possible. Two of our tracked geese switched from the North Sea population flyway to the Pannonic flyway during moult on Taimyr peninsula or early during the subsequent autumn migration. Because we could follow one of them during the next year, where it stayed in the Pannonic flyway, we suggest that the exchange was long-term or permanent.

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Regular, long-distance migrations of thousands of animal species have consequences for the ecosystems that they visit, modifying trophic interactions and transporting many non-pathogenic and pathogenic organisms. The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.

To study the activity budget of mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, in relation to time of the day, season and external factors, we used tags containing an accelerometer providing detailed activity information. We observed a relatively constant diel pattern with more activity during daylight than at night and peak activities during twilight. Activity over the season (September\\u2013April) was remarkably constant. Compared to the average activity per half-day, excess activity alternated every 12 h, suggesting an increased need for rest during daylight after a night with excess activity, and vice versa. Between days, activity was allocated to half-days in a very flexible manner: Either day or night activity was increased for a number of days, before increased activity gradually switched to the other half-day. We observed no synchrony in this pattern among individuals, highlighting the behavioural flexibility of this generalist species.\",\n",

During two consecutive fall migration periods, we caught immature females on a stopover site in southeast Sweden, and translocated a group of them ca. 1,000 km to southern Germany. We followed the movements of the ducks via satellite GPS-tracking and observed their migration decisions during the fall and consecutive spring migration. The control animals released in Ottenby behaved as expected from banding recoveries: they continued migration during the winter and in spring returned to the population\\u2019s breeding grounds in the Baltics and Northwest Russia. Contrary to the control animals, the translocated mallards did not continue migration and stayed at Lake Constance. In spring, three types of movement tactics could be observed: 61.5% of the ducks (16 of 26) stayed around Lake Constance, 27% (7 of 26) migrated in a northerly direction towards Sweden and 11.5% of the individuals (3 of 26) headed east for ca. 1,000 km and then north. We suggest that young female mallards flexibly adjust their migration tactics and develop a navigational map that allows them to return to their natal breeding area.\",\n",

But the Mesoamerican subspecies A. m. cyanoptera is highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss, largely driven by intentional forest fires, cattle ranching, and the expansion of human settlements. \\n\\nFor more than two decades, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been leading efforts to save MBR\\u2019s scarlet macaw population from extirpation through nest protection programs, monitoring macaw fledging rates at key nesting sites, raising awareness through environmental education involving local communities, and habitat protection initiatives including over flights. As a result, our scarlet macaw conservation strategy is based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the entire range of threats and interventions required to conserve the species in Guatemala. \\n\\nCurrently, we are working to accelerate the pace of recovery of the wild scarlet macaw population through a combination of complementary interventions, including management activities designed to maximize the potential contribution of the natural production of wild scarlet macaws. These include pulling of low weight chicks from their nests to be raised at a field laboratory, placement of laboratory-raised chicks back within foster wild nests when viable, or release of laboratory-raised macaws back into the wild following their preparation within an in \\u2013 situ flight cage. In addition, we are increasing the availability of nesting cavities by enlarging natural cavities to create potential nests, and preventing and combating Africanized bees\\u2019 infestation of nesting cavities. These bees are fervent competitors for nesting cavities and can kill young macaw chicks. Additionally, we have engaged local communities and partners in macaw conservation activities, such as AFISAP community forest concession that harbors important macaws nesting habitat.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Nevertheless, anosmic pigeons, Columba livia, show unimpaired navigation when released within a familiar area, suggesting that they may rely on familiar visual landmarks for navigation. However, direct evidence for the reliance on familiar visual landmarks during homing in anosmic birds has never been provided. In this study we tracked pigeons subjected singly to one training flight from each of three locations. Prior to their second release from each site, half of the birds were made anosmic while the others were not manipulated. The level of route fidelity was analysed separately for three phases of the homing process, in which familiar visual cues may have different relevance and may be used within different cognitive strategies: (1) \\u2018Initial decision making\\u2019; (2) \\u2018En route navigation\\u2019; (3) \\u2018Local navigation around home\\u2019. Compared to control birds, the anosmic birds flew significantly closer to previously overflown locations in the \\u2018En route navigation\\u2019 phase, while no difference in route fidelity emerged during phases (1) and (3). Our results showed that a single experience is sufficient for pigeons to learn release site features, and that familiar visual landmarks constitute a critical source of navigational information in olfactorily deprived birds during the homing process.\",\n",

Two study sites were selected for intensive investigations of the effects of military overflight activity on Dall\\u2019s sheep: the first site (Cirque Lake) is located in Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve and is overlain by airspace mitigated for Dall\\u2019s sheep. The second site (West Point) is located approximately 35 miles to the west of the 1st site and has no associated mitigation measure for Dall\\u2019s sheep. To investigate Dall\\u2019s sheep daily movements, home range size, and habitat use in relation to military aircraft activity, GPS radiocollars were placed on sheep captured at each site in March of 1999-2002. Blood sampling and a series of physical measurements took place during capturing, and mortalities were investigated as soon as was reasonable. Field data collection for this study also included aerial population surveys, sound level recordings and behavioral observations.

Unexpectedly, when hippocampal-lesioned, the pigeons displayed a notable change in their behaviour when navigating over the unfamiliar space distant from home; they actually flew straighter homeward-directed paths compared to their behaviour prior to lesion. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that following hippocampal lesion homing pigeons respond less to unfamiliar visual, topographic features encountered during homing, and as such, offer the first evidence of an unforeseen, pre-mnemonic neglect of environmental features following hippocampal damage.\",\n",

We investigated the effects of sensory manipulation on oceanic navigation in Scopoli\\u2019s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) breeding at Pianosa island (Italy), by displacing them 400 km from their colony and tracking them. A recent experiment on Atlantic shearwaters (Cory\\u2019s shearwater, Calonectris borealis) breeding in the Azores indicated a crucial role of olfaction over the open ocean, but left open the question of whether birds might navigate by topographical landmark cues when available. Our experiment was conducted in the Mediterranean sea, where the availability of topographical cues may provide an alternative navigational mechanism for homing. Magnetically disturbed shearwaters and control birds oriented homeward even when the coast was not visible and rapidly homed. Anosmic shearwaters oriented in a direction significantly different from the home direction when in open sea. After having approached a coastline their flight path changed from convoluted to homeward oriented, so that most of them eventually reached home. Beside confirming that magnetic cues appear unimportant for oceanic navigation by seabirds, our results support the crucial role of olfactory cues for birds\\u2019 navigation and reveal that anosmic shearwaters are able to home eventually by following coastal features.\",\n",

The mechanisms underlying their surprising navigational performance are still unknown. In order to investigate the nature of the cues exploited for oceanic navigation, Cory\\u2019s shearwaters, Calonectris borealis, nesting in the Azores were displaced and released in open ocean at about 800 km from their colony, after being subjected to sensory manipulation. While magnetically disturbed shearwaters showed unaltered navigational performance and behaved similarly to unmanipulated control birds, the shearwaters deprived of their sense of smell were dramatically impaired in orientation and homing. Our data show that seabirds use olfactory cues not only to\\nfind their food but also to navigate over vast distances in the ocean.\",\n",

These parameters were modelled against wind speed and direction, time of the day, solar irradiance (proxy of thermal uplift), starting altitude and distance to Morocco, and age and sex of birds. We found that sea crossing performance of black kites is driven by their age, the wind conditions, the starting altitude and the starting distance to Morocco. Young birds assumed more risks than adults by making longer sea crossings and reaching lower altitude above the sea. Crosswinds promoted longer sea crossings, with birds reaching lower altitudes and with higher flapping effort. Birds starting at lower altitudes were more likely to quit or made higher flapping effort to complete the sea crossing. The location where the birds started the sea crossings impacted crossing distance and duration.\",\n",

However, due to limitations in the transmission abilities of the Argos system and the battery life of the tags, very little is known about fine-scale diving behaviour over time or the reliability of assigning behavioral states from horizontal movement data for whale species. Whether whales swim close to the ocean surface or complete drift dives into deeper parts of the water column while migrating has not been examined, yet the strategy used is likely to influence the vulnerability of whales to risk factors such as ship strike. Here we present information from a rare week long deployment onto a pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) that provided the first opportunity to examine the long-term diving behaviour of a migrating whale, and to compare the location of feeding lunges to assigned behavioural states. \",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Neotropical orchid bees have occasionally been observed to travel large distances. If extensive pollinator movement is part of their normal routine, it could allow plants the bees pollinate to be rare and occur in widely scattered locations. However the absence of movement data from solitary bees presents a formidable challenge to quantitative prediction. Here we use micro radio telemetry to show that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large areas (at least 42 \\u2013 115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from core ranges. When following individual bees we found them to be stationary for variable lengths of time and then fly to a new site where again they remained stationary. In addition our data suggest a bimodal frequency distribution of home range sizes. We propose individuals either use multiple widely-separated core areas or have a central core with an extremely large periphery where they gather resources. We suggest that the large distances habitually travelled by the orchid bees have important implications for explaining orchid diversity and plant evolution.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"A domestic cat tracking study (Felis catus) run by The Discovery Circle at the University of South Australia: www.discoverycircle.org.au. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are a conservation concern because they kill billions of native prey each year, but without spatial context the ecological importance of pets as predators remains uncertain. We worked with citizen scientists to track 925 pet cats from six countries, finding remarkably small home ranges (3.6 \\u00b1 5.6 ha). Only three cats ranged > 1 km^2 and we found no relationship between home range size and the presence of larger native predators (i.e. coyotes, Canis latrans). Most (75%) cats used primarily (90%) disturbed habitats. Owners reported that their pets killed an average of 3.5 prey items/month, leading to an estimated ecological impact per cat of 14.2\\u201038.9 prey ha^\\u22121 yr^\\u22121. This is similar or higher than the per\\u2010animal ecological impact of wild carnivores but the effect is amplified by the high density of cats in neighborhoods. As a result, pet cats around the world have an ecological impact greater than native predators but concentrated within ~100 m of their homes.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a nomadic wading bird that is increasingly foraging in urban areas in parts of its range, relying on artificial wetlands and other anthropogenic resources year-round. In this study, we explore whether and how individual association with urban environments is predictive of consistent changes in behavioural season timing and length. Other urbanized species exhibit altered annual cycles such as loss of migratory behavior and year-round breeding in response to consistent resource abundance, often related to intentional and unintentional provisioning. We used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify differences in the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) related to use of urban habitats. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. In particular, ibis with higher urban habitat use in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that started earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats. This study reveals interesting behavioral patterns for a nomadic species with populations that are recently expanding into urban areas, providing evidence that ibis are adapting their annual cycles and seasonal behaviors to exploit urban resources.\",\n",

We worked with citizen scientists to track 925 pet cats from six countries, finding remarkably small home ranges (3.6 \\u00b1 5.6 ha). Only three cats ranged > 1 km^2 and we found no relationship between home range size and the presence of larger native predators (i.e. coyotes, Canis latrans). Most (75%) cats used primarily (90%) disturbed habitats. Owners reported that their pets killed an average of 3.5 prey items/month, leading to an estimated ecological impact per cat of 14.2\\u201038.9 prey ha^\\u22121 yr^\\u22121. This is similar or higher than the per\\u2010animal ecological impact of wild carnivores but the effect is amplified by the high density of cats in neighborhoods. As a result, pet cats around the world have an ecological impact greater than native predators but concentrated within ~100 m of their homes.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Gliding saves much energy, and to make large distances using only this form of flight represents a great challenge for both birds and people. The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization including the skillful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common features in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem to reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best slope to take before an upcoming thermal.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Many migratory animals travel in large social groups. Large, avian migrants that fly in V-formations were proposed do so for energy saving by the use of up-wash by following individuals and regularly change leadership. As groups have been rather homogeneous in previous work, we aimed to explore leadership and its flight mechanics consequences in an extremely heterogeneous case of social migration, namely in spring migration of goose families. In families the experience of group members differs strongly and inclusive fitness may be important. We successfully collected overlapping spring migration tracking data of a complete family of greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons) and extracted leadership, flapping frequency and wind conditions in flight. Our data revealed V-formations where one parent was flying in front at all times. Although the father led the family group most of the time, he did not flap at higher frequency while doing so. In contrast, the mother flapped faster when leading, possibly because she experienced less supportive wind conditions than when the father led. We argue that in heterogeneous, social groups leadership might be fixed and not costly if supportive environmental conditions like wind can be used.\",\n",

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. \\n\\nThe primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Semipalmated Sandpipers during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. \\n\\nIn 2017, we equipped 68 Semipalmated Sandpipers at four Arctic-breeding locations (Canning River, Colville River, Prudhoe Bay, and Utqiagvik) with 1.2 g Pinpoint 10 GPS Swift tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every day from June 20 to September 15, then 1 location every three days from November 6 to March 23. In 2018, we retrieved 1 of these tags from Prudhoe Bay for data download. This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).

      "    \"study_objective\": \"American woodcock Scolopax minor (hereafter woodcock) migration ecology is poorly understood, but has implications for population ecology and management, especially related to harvest. To describe woodcock migration patterns and phenology, we captured and equipped 73 woodcock with satellite tracking devices in the Central Management Region (analogous to the Mississippi Flyway) of North America and documented migration paths of 60 individual woodcock and 87 autumn or spring woodcock migrations during 2014\\u20132016. Woodcock migration at the scale of the Central Management Region was more synchronous in spring than in autumn, but unlike most other migratory birds, average duration of autumn migration (31 days) was shorter than duration of spring migration (53 days). This difference in migration duration resulted from woodcock making more close-together migratory stopovers during spring migration, not because woodcock had individual stopovers of longer duration. During autumn migration, the number of days, the number of stopovers, migration end date and net migration displacement were negatively related to initiation date and rate of migration, and the number of stopovers and the net migration displacement were negatively related with migration end date. Spring migration duration, end date, the number of stopovers and net migration displacement were negatively related to migration rate and initiation date was positively related to migration rate, suggesting that woodcock that initiated spring migration later had faster migration rates. Juvenile female woodcock began spring migration later than adult female woodcock. Our results provide a basis for comparing current harvest seasons with presence of migrating woodcock during autumn and provide insight into differential harvest of migratory versus local woodcock on breeding areas.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"We assessed a suite of movement metrics derived from GPS trajectories of thirteen marine and terrestrial vertebrate species spanning three taxonomic classes, orders of magnitude in body size, and modes of movement (swimming, flying, walking). Using these metrics, we performed a principal components analysis and cluster analysis to determine if individuals organized into statistically distinct clusters. To identify and interpret commonalities within clusters, we compared them to computer-simulated idealized movement syndromes representing suites of correlated movement traits observed across taxa (migration, nomadism, territoriality, and central place foraging). Two principal components explained 70% of the variance among the movement metrics we evaluated across the thirteen species, and were used for the cluster analysis. The resulting analysis revealed four statistically distinct clusters. All simulated individuals of each idealized movement syndrome organized into separate clusters, suggesting that the four clusters are explained by common movement syndrome. Our results offer early indication of widespread recurrent patterns in movement ecology that have consistent statistical signatures, regardless of taxon, body size, mode of movement, or environment.\",\n",

Our understanding, however, of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited. Here we report on the hunting dynamics of the world\\u2019s fastest land animal, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. Using miniaturized data loggers, we recorded fine-scale movement, speed and acceleration of free-ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey. Cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m/s and accelerated up to 7.5 m/s2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt. The interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type. Thus, rather than a simple maximum speed chase, cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey, before reducing speed 5-8 s from the end of the hunt, so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics, varying the precise strategy according to prey species. Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival.\",\n",

Specifically, the program has been longitudinally monitoring the ecology, behavior, health and reproduction of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) living in low versus high human activity areas. We also have been evaluating the impact of domestic animals, especially dogs on the health of the carnivore community, in particular maned wolves. The research has been conducted with the different approaches, however data from radiotelemetry has been the starting point for all the crossed analysis. \\nSince 2004, 73 animals have been collared. Until 2009 the option of using conventional telemetry restrained us to certain information collected. Since 2007 we have been using GPS-based telemetry in order to obtain more specific information. The data collected from the 13 GPS-collared animals in the last 8 years have been essential for management practices in the project\\u2019s site and has been influenced public policies and even the species status in the Brazilian Red List.\\n\",\n",

We evaluated performance of traditional and snapshot micro-GPS (< 20 g) receivers on a small, semi-fossorial lagomorph, the pygmy rabbit, to understand how GPS errors might influence fine-scale assessments of space use and habitat selection. During stationary tests, microtopography and satellite geometry had the largest influence on GPS fix success rate (FSR) and location error (LE). There was no difference between FSR while animals wore the GPS collars above ground and FSR generated during stationary, above-ground trials, suggesting that animal behavior other than burrowing did not markedly influence micro-GPS errors. In our study, traditional micro-GPS receivers demonstrated similar FSR and LE to snapshot receivers, however, snapshot receivers operated inconsistently due to battery and software failures. In contrast, the initial traditional receivers deployed on animals experienced some breakages, but a modified collar design consistently functioned as expected.

Flight movements of Red Kites are recorded with GPS-loggers and/or a laser-range-finder before and after the construction of the research wind turbines and will be linked to meteorological data in order to identify conditions with high collision risk. Furthermore, flight movement data are used to test the function of different automatic bird detection systems. The results of the tests will be used as a base for elaborating a profile of realistic requirements for automatic bird detection systems in order to set standards in the context of bird protection and nature conservation regarding bird collisions at wind turbines.\\n\",\n",

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. \\n\\nThe primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Red Phalarope during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. \\n\\nIn 2019 and 2020, we equipped 31 Red Phalarope at 7 Arctic-breeding locations (Utqiagvik, Canning River, Colville River, Qupaluk, Cambridge Bay, East Bay and Igloolik) with 2 g PTT tags (Microwave Telemetry).

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Background: The European Kingfisher (Alcedo Atthis) is a small plunge-diving bird, today considered as a species of conservation concern in Europe given the rapid population declines observed across the continent. Considering the importance to document home range features of the this species for its conservation and the interest in documenting potential effects of radio or GPS tracking techniques in the framework of research conservation schemes dedicated to small plunge-diving birds, we implemented a pilot study aimed at providing first data allowing to: (i) assess home range features of the European Kingfisher for populations with feeding locations unevenly distributed; (ii) define conservation implications for habitats exploited by such populations; (iii) evaluate possibilities to develop GPS tracking schemes dedicated to home range studies for this species of conservation concern that may be possibly developed for other small plunge-diving birds.\\n\\nMethods: In 2018 and 2019, we equipped 16 breeding European Kingfishers (Alcedo atthis) sampled within the marshes of the Gironde Estuary (France), with miniaturized and waterproof GPS archival tags deployed with leg-loop harness (total mass equipment = 1.4 g; average bird mass = 40.18 \\u00b1 1.12 g).\\n\\nResults: We obtained an average record per tag retrieved (n = 13) of 35.31 \\u00b1 6.66 locations usable for analyses, without significant effects on bird body condition. For the sampled population, data analysis highlight rather small home ranges exploited by birds (average = 2.50 \\u00b1 0.55 ha) composed, on average by 2.78 \\u00b1 0.40 clusters of locations. Our results also highlight: (i) a rather important home range fragmentation index (average of the summed area pooling all clusters, divided by the area encompassing all clusters = 0.36 \\u00b1 0.08); (ii) the use by birds of different types of small wetlands (wet ditches or small ponds within alluvial forests), often exploited in addition to habitats encompassing nest locations.\\n\\nConclusion: Our study reveals interesting GPS tracking possibilities for small plunge-diving birds such as the European Kingfisher. For this species, today classified as vulnerable in Europe, our results underline the importance to develop conservation and ecological restoration policies of wetland networks, integrating small wetlands particularly sensitive to global change.\",\n",

To reveal the exact moulting sites, in 2016 ten cygnets were fitted with 91g solar-powered neck-collar-mounted GPS-GSM loggers. Moulting sites were recorded for four individuals in their 2nd calendar year, and for two of these birds in their 3rd calendar year; four birds in total. All of these moulted at sites in Russia; one was in the Republic of Karelia and three were in the Arkhangelsk Region. The mean average straight-line distance between the hatching and moulting sites was 1,451 km (range = 1,038\\u20132,524 km). Although the data were less comprehensive, another tracked swan probably moulted in the western part of the White Sea in the Republic of Karelia. The conservation of these moulting sites is essential for the Latvian Whooper Swans to thrive. This study is participating in the Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA).\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"During the day, flying animals exploit the environmental energy landscape by seeking out thermal or orographic uplift, or extracting energy from wind gradients. However, most of these energy sources are not thought to be available at night because of the lower thermal potential in the nocturnal atmosphere, as well as the difficulty of locating features that generate uplift. Despite this, several bat species have been observed hundreds to thousands of meters above the ground. Individuals make repeated, energetically costly high-altitude ascents, and others fly at some of the fastest speeds observed for powered vertebrate flight. We hypothesized that bats use orographic uplift to reach high altitudes, and that both this uplift and bat high-altitude ascents would be highly predictable. By superimposing detailed three-dimensional GPS tracking of European free-tailed bats (Tadarida teniotis) on high-resolution regional wind data, we show that bats do indeed use the energy of orographic uplift to climb to over 1,600 m, and also that they reach maximum sustained self-powered airspeeds of 135 km h\\u22121. We show that wind and topography can predict areas of the landscape able to support high-altitude ascents, and that bats use these locations to reach high altitudes while reducing airspeeds. Bats then integrate wind conditions to guide high-altitude ascents, deftly exploiting vertical wind energy in the nocturnal landscape.\",\n",

Tags logged 1-Hz data from tri-axial accelerometers,\\nmagnetometers, and a depth sensor, while acquiring Fastloc GPS locations. Tag\\nattachment duration ranged from 18.3 to 28.9 d for blue whales and 4.9\\u201316.0 d\\nfor fin whales, recording 1,030\\u20134,603 dives and 95\\u20133,338 GPS locations per whale\\nacross both species. Feeding lunges (identified from accelerometer data) were used\\nto characterize \\u201cfeeding bouts\\u201d (i.e., sequences of feeding dives with <60 min of\\nconsecutive non-feeding dives), within-bout behavior, and to examine the spatial\\ndistribution of feeding effort. Whales fed near the tagging locations (Point Mugu and\\nSan Miguel Island) for up to 7 d before dispersing as far south as Ensenada, Mexico,\\nand north to Cape Mendocino, California. Dispersal within southern California waters\\ndiffered by sex in both species with males undertaking offshore, circuitous excursions,\\nwhile females remained more coastal, suggesting that movement patterns on the feeding\\ngrounds may not be exclusively related to energy gain. Feeding bout characteristics\\nwere similar for both species, with the median bout having 24 dives and lasting 3.3 h\\nfor blue whales (n = 242), and 19 dives while lasting 2.7 h for fin whales (n = 59). Bout\\nduration was positively correlated with the number of feeding lunges per dive within a\\nbout for both species, suggesting whales left poor-quality prey patches quickly but fed\\nintensively for up to 34.9 h when prey was abundant. Feeding bouts occurred further\\napart as the distance from shore increased, but there was no corresponding difference\\nin the number of feeding lunges per dive, suggesting the whales were feeding at the\\nsame rate throughout their range, but that prey was more dispersed in offshore waters.\\nThis may be evidence of two feeding strategies, with spatially aggregated foraging around\\nhighly localized, topographically forced upwelling centers nearshore, and more dispersed\\nforaging in larger areas of elevated, but patchy, productivity offshore.\",\n",

To undertake this ambitious project we have compiled a multidisciplinary team from\\nkey local organisations, including NGRREC, SLU, WashU, StlZoo, and Forest Park Forever. We anticipate\\nour project will advance scientific theory, improve management of urban biodiversity, and inspire St.\\nLouisans and others to a deeper wonder of and care for biodiversity. We are requesting funding from\\nLEC to address four objectives:\\n1. Attach biologgers to 2-5 individuals of 12 focal vertebrates that span trophic levels and aquatic,\\nterrestrial and aerial habitats.\\n2. Quantify reference health and disease profiles of the animals we tag.\\n3. Build an online repository to showcase the movement of biodiversity in an urban park that will be\\nuseful to both scientists and the general public.\\n4. Develop outreach/education efforts in the St Louis region focused on urban biodiversity, including:\\na. a joint undergraduate/graduate course in urban wildlife ecology and evolution at WashU,\\nSLU, NGRREC and Harris Stowe.\\nb. facilitating student-led outreach with community schools in St. Louis city.\\n\",\n",

Changes in reporting rates from bird atlas surveys suggest declines of up to 60 % over the last 20 years (1987-1982 vs. 2007-2013) across South Africa. Worryingly, large protected areas were not immune to these declines. For instance reporting rates in Kruger National Park (KNP; ca. 20,000 km2), an area often considered a stronghold for Martial Eagles, recorded a 54 % decline in reporting rates. It is not clear what the major drivers of declines have been in South Africa, nor what is contributing to the declines in these large protected areas. In this study we investigate the ecology of Martial Eagles in KNP to improve our understanding of the threats they face and how these threats at various stages in their life cycle may be driving declines within protected areas where one would expect that the species should be well conserved. \",\n",

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds\\u2019 precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

We compared the timing of migratory movements of Arctic-breeding geese on different flyways (Greenland (N=7), Svalbard (N=21) and the Barents Sea (N=12)) to examine whether flyways differed in the predictability of spring conditions at stopovers, and whether this was reflected in the degree to which birds were following the green wave. The numerous stopover sites of all birds were combined into a set of 16 general stopover regions. The predictability of climatic conditions along the flyways differed between sites, mainly because of the presence or absence of ecological barriers. Goose arrival at stopovers was more closely tied to the local onset of spring when predictability was higher and when geese attempted breeding that year. All birds arrived at early stopovers after the onset of spring and arrived at the breeding grounds before the onset of spring, thus overtaking the green wave. This is in accordance with patterns expected for capital breeders: first they must come into condition; at intermediate stopovers arrival with the food quality peak is important to stay in condition; and at the breeding grounds early arrival is favoured so that hatching of young can coincide with the peak of food quality. However, the birds\\u2019 precision of migratory timing seems uninfluenced by ecological barriers, indicating partly fixed migration schedules.

We differentiated seven classes of land cover\\u2014alfalfa, annually rotated irrigated crops, developed, grassland, orchard / vineyard, rice, and water. From 2011\\u20132013, we fitted transmitters with global positioning systems to 23 adult Swainson\\u2019s Hawks. We recorded a minimum of six locations per day per bird from spring through early autumn of each year. We used a fixed, bivariate-normal kernel estimator to calculate a utilization distribution at 30-m resolution for each life stage of each individual within each year. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the associations between intensity of space use and land cover, sex, and reproductive status. The majority of adult Swainson\\u2019s Hawks traveled distances up to 8\\u201310 km from the nest throughout the breeding season. Median seasonal home-range sizes in a given year ranged from 87\\u2013172 km2. The association between intensity of space use and grassland was 50\\u2013139% stronger, and the association between intensity of space use and alfalfa 23\\u201359% stronger, than the associations between intensity of space use and any other land-cover type. Intensity of space use did not vary as a function of sex, reproductive status, or life stage. Given our results and additional knowledge of the species\\u2019 ecology, we suggest that reproductive success and, in turn, population-level recruitment may be associated equally if not more closely with availability of nesting sites than with the current distribution of land cover.\\n\\nData fields are as follows.\\nid: The unique identifier for the tracked individual.\\ndatetime: The date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.

      "    \"study_objective\": \"(1) Camera traps are used increasingly to estimate population density for elusive and difficult to observe species. A standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. However, for many species it is unclear whether track\\u2010based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density. (2) Understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera\\u2010based wildlife surveys. (3) We evaluated the effect of camera\\u2010trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, over a two\\u2010year period in a semi\\u2010arid conservation reserve in south\\u2010eastern Australia. Further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via GPS collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark\\u2013resight methods. (4) Fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off\\u2010track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. However, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes. (5) Our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark\\u2013resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. Nonetheless, camera surveys based either on\\u2010 or off\\u2010track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark\\u2013resight models. This underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera\\u2010trap surveys.\",\n",

Little is known about the natural history and ecology of the striped mud turtle (Kinosternon baurii), although previous work in Florida suggest that these aquatic turtles are highly terrestrial and nest primarily in the fall. We are currently conducting a population and spatial ecology project on the striped mud turtle using radio telemetry at Circle B Bar Reserve, a restored former cattle ranch adjacent to Lake Hancock, Polk County, Florida. To date, we are tracking six striped mud turtles, and we are collecting standard natural history data on morphology and reproduction. In addition, we have implemented a continuous mark and recapture study for this population. Our data indicate that these mud turtles have a fairly small home range (no single movement more than 75m) with males generally moving more often and greater distances than females. The health of captured turtles is generally good, although feral pigs and human interactions (especially after national news events) appear to represent the greatest threats to the turtles. The population at Circle B does not appear to be dense, as we recapture many of the same turtles. However, after almost 2 years of sampling, we are still capturing unmarked turtles and the population is represented by multiple size classes from small juveniles to large females. Overall, the data we have collected is helping Circle B Bar Reserve understand more about their striped mud turtle population and expands their knowledge of the wildlife they protect. With specific knowledge on the population size and habitat use, Circle B and other reserves/parks in central Florida can better accommodate small, often overlooked aquatic turtles into their management plans.\\n \\n\",\n",

Please contact the data owner at wgetz@berkeley.edu for the full dataset. The relationship between resource availability and wildlife movement patterns is pivotal to understanding species behavior and ecology. Movement response to landscape variables occurs at multiple temporal scales, from sub-diurnal to multiannual. Additionally, individuals may respond to both current and past conditions of resource availability. In this paper, we examine the temporal scale and variation of current and past resource variables that affect movement patterns of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using sub-hourly movement data from GPS-GSM collared elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We created detailed satellite-based spatiotemporal maps of vegetation biomass, as well as distance from surface water, road and fence. We used step selection functions to measure the relative importance of these landscape variables in determining elephants\\u2019 local movement patterns. We also examined how elephants respond to information, in locations they have previously visited, on productivity integrated over different temporal scales: from current to historical conditions. Our results demonstrate that elephants choose patches with higher-than average annual productivity and grass biomass, but lower tree biomass. Elephants also prefer to walk close to water, roads, and fences. These preferences vary with time of day and with season, thereby providing insights into diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns and the ecological importance of the landscape variables examined. We also discovered that elephants respond more strongly to long-term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions, in familiar locations. Our results illustrate how animals with high cognitive capacity and spatial memory integrate long-term information on landscape conditions. We illuminate the importance of long-term high temporal resolution satellite imagery to understanding the relationship between movement patterns and landscape structure.\",\n",

These studies highlighted the complexity of long-distance navigation in homing pigeons, which remains a poorly investigated aspect. In this tracking study we report how the homing performances of pigeons housed in Amino (Pisa, Italy) were affected by the presence/absence of a mountain range (the Northern Apennines) interposed between the home and the release site area (release sites: Trans = mountain barrier, Cis = no mountain barrier). We displaced unmanipulated control pigeons, anosmic pigeon, and pigeons transported in purified air to release sites located at a distance ranging between 95 and 246 km from home. There, birds were released without further manipulation. The navigational performances of anosmic pigeons were impaired at both Cis and Trans sites compared to both smelling groups. Both unmanipulated control pigeons and pigeons transported in purified air but allowed to smell environmental air at both the release site and after release displayed unimpaired navigational abilities at the Cis site, but impaired homing success and impaired homeward orientation at the Trans sites. Nevertheless, their homeward component was significantly greater than that of the anosmic birds at both geographical areas. This suggests that the Northern Apennine acts as a geographical barrier affecting the olfactory map accuracy of Amino pigeons, rather than totally reducing its spatial extent.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Anim. Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size\\ndimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic\\nrequirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes\\ndiffer in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We\\ntherefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during\\nthe incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated\\nweighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used\\ncoastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition\\nbetween the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and\\nability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental\\nconditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt\\nmodels suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have\\nslightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature.\\nThe different energetic requirements related to the birds\\u2019 incubation and chick-provisioning pattern\\nseem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly\\nproductive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for\\nthemselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.\\n\\nPLoS One:\\nLogger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling\\nand logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern\\nrockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/\\n0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and\\nphysiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used\\nin all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were\\npreviously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study.\\nIncreased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also\\nfound GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding\\nseasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact\\nof logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies\\nwith birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS\\nand TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein,\\ntriglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1\\u20133 days) showed limited\\nimpact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving\\nseabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey.\\nResults obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.\",\n",

However, little is known about migratory movements and connectivity of shorebird populations. By identifying migratory stop-over and wintering areas, we can begin to identify sites that should be conserved and evaluate the relative risks of development and climate change scenarios. \\n\\nThe primary objective of this study is to collect baseline information on movement patterns of Whimbrels during the post-breeding period so we can identify important migratory stop-over, breeding, and wintering locations; determine habitat selection patterns; determine migratory connectivity among geographic regions; estimate residency times at stop-over sites; and evaluate effects of future environmental change scenarios on shorebird use. \\n\\nIn 2019, we equipped 1 Whimbrel on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with 4.8 g Pinpoint GPS ARGOS tags (Lotek Wireless). These tags were programmed to collect 1 location every 2 days beginning on 20 June. However, please do not use this information without first consulting the authors. \",\n",

The behavioural adjustments to high-altitude flights are largely unknown. We studied thermalling flights of Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis) from 50 to 6500 m above sea level, a twofold range of air densities. To create the necessary lift to support the same weight and maintain soaring flight in thin air birds might modify lift coefficient by biophysical changes, such as wing posture and increasing the power expenditure. Alternatively, they can change their flight characteristics. We show that vultures use the latter and increase circle radius by 35% and airspeed by 21% over their flight altitude range. These simple behavioural adjustments enable vultures to move seamlessly during their annual migrations over the Himalaya without increasing energy output to flight in high elevations.\",\n",

Ecuadorian populations are isolated from the rest of the distribution range, and are scattered in a handful of small groups of 5-30 individuals.  Little is known on this marginal subpopulation which likely represents a distinct evolutionary branch due to its marked isolation.

We found that a sample of gannets tracked in 2015 had longer trip durations, travelled further from the colony and had larger core foraging areas and home range areas than gannets tracked in previous years. Our findings suggest that this inter-annual variation was driven by individuals visiting larger areas in all of their trips rather than individuals diversifying to visit more, distinct areas.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Several laboratory studies have revealed functional hemispheric lateralization in birds performing visual tasks. However, the role of functional brain asymmetries in spatial behaviour in natural settings is still poorly investigated. We studied monocularly occluded homing pigeons, Columba livia, to investigate potential differences in the hemispheric control of navigational performance. We GPS-tracked monoc- ularly occluded and control binocular homing pigeons during seven group training releases and a final solitary release from each of two sites. The pigeons were then given one last release from each site after a phase shift of the light-dark cycle under binocular conditions, to distinguish compass-based orientation from landmark-based pilotage. Overall, pigeons homing with the left eye/right hemisphere (RH) dis- played a greater fidelity to the familiar space previously experienced than pigeons homing with the right eye/left hemisphere (LH). Another difference between the two monocular groups is that LH pigeons were more likely than RH pigeons to fly with other pigeons during the group training releases. The data support the hypothesis that the left eye/right hemisphere plays a more substantial role as pigeons develop fidelity to certain routes to home from familiar release sites, an enhanced fidelity that may be supported by superior memory for familiar landmarks.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Knowing the influence of intrinsic and environmental traits on animals\\u2019 movement is a central interest of ecology and can aid to enhance management decisions. The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a vulnerable mammal that presents low capacity for physiological thermoregulation and uses forests as thermal shelters. Here, we aim to provide reliable estimates of giant anteaters\\u2019 movement patterns and home range size, as well as untangle the role of intrinsic and environmental drivers on their movement. We GPS-tracked 19 giant anteaters in Brazilian savannah. We used a continuous-time movement model to estimate their movement patterns (described by home range crossing time, daily distance moved and directionality), and provide an autocorrelated kernel density estimate of home range size. Then, we used mixed structural equations to integratively model the effects of sex, body mass and proportion of forest cover on movement patterns and home range size, considering the complex net of interactions between these variables. Male giant anteaters presented more intensive space use and larger home range than females with similar body mass, as it is expected in polygynous social mating systems. Males and females increased home range size with increasing body mass, but the allometric scaling of intensity of space use was negative for males and positive for females, indicating different strategies in search for resources. With decreasing proportion of forest cover inside their home ranges, and, consequently, decreasing thermal quality of their habitat, giant anteaters increased home range size, possibly to maximize the chances of accessing thermal shelters. As frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and deforestation are increasing, effective management efforts need to consider the role of forests as an important thermal resource driving spatial requirements of this species. We highlight that both intrinsic and environmental drivers of animal movement should be integrated to better guide management strategies. \",\n",

Murres captured small prey at all phases of a dive, including while descending and ascending, but captured large fish mostly while ascending, with considerably longer handling times. Birds captured larger prey and dove deeper during chick\\u2010rearing. As central place foraging theory predicted, birds travelling further also brought bigger prey items for their chick. The location of a dive (distance from colony and distance to shore) best explained which prey type was the most likely to get caught in a dive, and we created a preyscape surrounding our study colony.

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Over the last decade, ocean sunfish movements have been monitored worldwide using various satellite tracking methods. This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced\\nby analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by\\nthe tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the\\ndistribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant\\nsimulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r s = 0.184, p=0.001).\\nThe model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current\\nflow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator\\u2019s\\nfine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Yellow-eyed penguins are known to be predominantly benthic foragers that feed on fish species that live at or close to the seafloor. This foraging strategy makes the penguins particularly susceptible to set net operations that go after dogfish or school shark at the seafloor. Yellow-eyed penguin numbers are currently in free fall all along the mainland with climate change and fisheries interactions being suspected to play an important role in the current trends. However, the accurate assessment of fisheries impacts is hampered by a lack of data of the penguins\\u2019 utilization of the marine habitat. While some tracking work has been conducted in the past few years, our understanding of the penguins\\u2019 foraging ranges throughout the year is extremely limited. In some regions, we have no idea where the penguins go to find food and whether their home ranges overlap with commercial set net fisheries. This project aims at filling this knowledge gap quickly in an effort to manage potential fisheries impacts and eliminate this factor from the species\\u2019 list of threats.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Background: The introduction of animal tracking technology has rapidly advanced our understanding of seabird foraging ecology. Tracking data is particularly powerful when combined with oceanographic information derived from satellite remote sensing, allowing insights into the functional mechanisms of marine ecosystems. While this framework has been used extensively over the last two decades, there are still vast ocean regions and many seabird species for which information is scarce, particularly in tropical oceans. \\nMethods: In this study we tracked the movement at high GPS recording frequency of 15 White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) during chick-rearing from a colony in Fernando de Noronha (offshore of Northeast Brazil). Flight behaviours of travelling and searching for food were derived from GPS data and examined in relation to satellite-sensed oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration). \\nResults: White-tailed Tropicbirds showed marked preference for clear and warm sea surface waters, which are indicative of low primary productivity but are likely the best habitat for preying upon flying fish. \\nDiscussion: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that foraging habitat choices of tropical seabirds may not be driven by primary productivity, as has been widely shown for non-tropical species. \",\n",

Our study determines multi-dimensional differentiation of two sympatric top-predators, long-legged buzzards (LLB) and short-toed eagles (STE), which recently became sympatric during their breeding season in the Judean Foothills, Israel. By combining information from comprehensive diet and movement analyses we found four dimensions of differentiation: (1) Geographic foraging area: LLB tended to forage relatively close to their nests (2.35\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090.62\\u2009km), while STE forage far from their nest (13.03\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.20\\u2009km); (2) Foraging-habitat type: LLBs forage at low natural vegetation, avoiding cultivated fields, whereas STEs forage in cultivated fields, avoiding low natural vegetation; (3) Diurnal dynamics of foraging: LLBs are uniformly active during daytime, whereas STEs activity peaks in the early afternoon; and (4) Food-niche: while both species largely rely on reptiles (47.8% and 76.3% for LLB and STE, respectively), LLB had a more diverse diet and consumed significantly higher percentages of lizards, while STE consumed significantly higher percentages of snakes. Our results suggest that this multidimensional differentiation allows the spatial coexistence of these two dense populations in the study area.\",\n",

The so-called \\u201colfactory activation hypothesis\\u201d challenged the specific role of olfactory cues in navigation by suggesting that olfactory stimuli only activate a navigational system that is based on non-olfactory cues, predicting that even artificial odourants alone are sufficient to allow unimpaired navigation. In this experiment, we compared tracks of experimental birds exposed to different olfactory stimuli before being made anosmic at the release site prior to release. One group of pigeons was exposed to purified air enriched with artificial odourants, while a second group was exposed to environmental air. The birds stimulated with artificial nonsense odourants displayed several behavioural differences from both untreated controls and anosmic pigeons exposed to environmental air prior to release: nonsense odourants birds were unable to determine the home direction, they mostly flew within a space outside the homeward oriented quadrant, and they flew shorter distances on the day of release. Our data failed to support a mere activational role of olfactory stimuli in navigation, and are consistent with the olfactory navigation hypothesis.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Commercial fisheries may impact marine ecosystems and affect populations of predators like seabirds. In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.\\n\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"1. GPS\\u2010tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri\\u2010axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount or raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission.\\n2. Here we propose compressing the raw ACC data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity.\\n3. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) collected in spring 2017. By using software settings in which bouts of 2\\u00a0s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. \\n4. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a 6 time reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals\\u2019 time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals.\\n5. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well\\u2010considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately these developments can allow for long\\u2010term and nearly continuous remote\\u2010monitoring of the behaviour of free\\u2010ranging animals.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Mechanisms that determine how, where and when ontogenetic habitat shifts occur are mostly unknown in wild populations. Differences in size and environmental characteristics of ontogenetic habitats can lead to differences in movement patterns, behaviour, habitat use and spatial distributions across individuals of the same species. Knowledge of juvenile loggerhead turtles\\u2019 dispersal, movements and habitat use is largely unknown, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite relay data loggers were used to monitor movements, diving behaviour and water temperature of eleven large juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) deliberately caught in an oceanic habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. Hidden Markov Models were used over 4430 spatial locations to quantify the different activities performed by each individual: transit, low and high intensity diving. Model results were then analysed in relation to water temperature, bathymetry and distance to the coast. The Hidden Markov Model differentiated between bouts of Area Restricted Search as low and high intensity diving, and transit movements. The turtles foraged in deep oceanic waters within 60 km from the coast as well as above 140 km from the coast. They used an average area of 194802 km2, where most individuals used the deepest part of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea with the highest seamounts, while only two switched to neritic foraging showing plasticity in foraging strategies among turtles of similar age classes. The foraging distribution of large juvenile loggerhead turtles, including some which were of the minimum size of adults, in the Tyrrhenian Sea is mainly concentrated in a relatively small oceanic area with predictable mesoscale oceanographic features, despite the proximity of suitable neritic foraging habitats. Our study highlights the importance of collecting high-resolution data about species distribution and behaviour across different spatio-temporal scales and life stages for implementing conservation and Dynamic Ocean Management actions.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Baleen whale migrations typically consist of annual movements between productive, high-latitude feeding grounds and unproductive, low-latitude breeding grounds. However, the actual migratory path and whales\\u2019 behaviour in these locations are poorly known. The objectives of this study were to apply a switching state-space model to the satellite tracks of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Northeast Pacific to improve location estimation and gain insight into the migratory (transiting) and foraging (area-restricted search, ARS) behaviours of this population. During the period 1993 to 2007, Argos satellite tags were attached to 159 whales, mainly off the coast of California during late summer, of which 92 tracks were >7 d in duration. There was generally a southward movement during the winter to Baja California and to an area west of the Costa Rica Dome, in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Travel speeds during transit were significantly faster than during ARS movements (mean = 3.70 and 1.05 km h^\\u20131, respectively). On average, 29% of the track time was spent in ARS, and the mean time within an ARS patch was 21 d. The occurrence of ARS behaviour throughout the migration cycle suggests that these animals may forage year-round, but could also indicate limited movements during the reproductive season. The extent of their northward migration from Baja California to Washington varied significantly interannually, likely in response to environmental changes affecting their prey. The long track durations obtained from electronic tagging have provided essential new information about the critical habitats of Northeast Pacific blue whales.\",\n",

In April 2014, Pilanesberg had three adult cheetahs; the newly reintroduced female and the coalition of two adult males. The focal study animal was this adult female that was initially held in a boma at Madikwe Game Reserve for \\u223c3 months and \\u2018hard released\\u2019 into Pilanesberg with a fitted satellite collar. She was monitored by the first and fifth authors on a daily and monthly basis by satellite and radio-telemetry, respectively; while all cheetahs were also monitored by opportunistic observations by tourists and guides.\",\n",

This dataset comprises GPS location for 81 Eastern Brown pelicans (25 in Florida, 27 in Louisiana, and 29 in Texas) tracked from 2013-04-24 to 2016-02-05. We have used tracking data to analyze preferred marine habitat characteristics and analyze individual and colony-wide variation in home ranges, habitat characteristics, and migratory patterns.\",\n",

Even for the best-studied dispersal system of the Neotropics, Virola nobilis, the dispersal kernel remains unknown. We combined high-resolution GPS/3D-acceleration bird tracking, seed retention experiments, and field observations to quantify dispersal of V. nobilis by their principal dispersers, Ramphastos toucans. We inferred feeding events from movement data, and then estimated spatio-temporally explicit seed-dispersal kernels. Toucans moved an average of 1.8 km d-1 with two distinct activity peaks. Seed retention time averaged 25.5 min (range 4-98 min). Estimated seed dispersal distance averaged 144\\u00b1147m, with a 56% likelihood of dispersal >100m; this is 2X further than the behaviour-naive estimate from the same data. Dispersal was furthest for seeds ingested in the morning (morning mean 152\\u00b1154m, midday mean 95\\u00b183m), and increased with seed retention time, but only up to 60 min after feeding. Our study supports the long-standing hypothesis that toucans are excellent dispersers of Virola seeds. To maximize seed dispersal distances trees should ripen fruit in the morning when birds move the most, and produce fruits with gut-processing times around 60 min. We also demonstrate how new tracking technology can yield nuanced seed dispersal kernels for animals that cannot be directly observed.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Here, we describe the diving behavior of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) using the Advanced Dive Behavior (ADB) tag, which records depth data at 1\\u2010Hz resolution and GPS\\u2010quality locations for over 1 month, before releasing from the whale for recovery. A total of 27 ADB tags were deployed on sperm whales in the central Gulf of California, Mexico, during spring 2007 and 2008, of which 10 were recovered for data download. Tracking durations of all tags ranged from 0 to 34.5 days (median = 2.3 days), and 0.6 to 26.6 days (median = 5.0 days) for recovered tags. Recovered tags recorded a median of 50.8 GPS\\u2010quality locations and 42.6 dives per day. Dive summary metrics were generated for archived dives and were subsequently classified into six categories using hierarchical cluster analysis. A mean of 77% of archived dives per individual were one of four dive categories with median Maximum Dive Depth >290 m (V\\u2010shaped, Mid\\u2010water, Benthic, or Variable), likely associated with foraging. Median Maximum Dive Depth was <30 m for the other two categories (Short\\u2010 and Long\\u2010duration shallow dives), likely representing socializing or resting behavior. Most tagged whales remained near the tagging area during the tracking period, but one moved north of Isla Tibur\\u00f3n, where it appeared to regularly dive to, and travel along the seafloor. Three whales were tagged on the same day in 2007 and subsequently traveled in close proximity (<1 km) for 2 days. During this period, the depth and timing of their dives were not coordinated, suggesting they were foraging on a vertically heterogeneous prey field. The multiweek dive records produced by ADB tags enabled us to generate a robust characterization of the diving behavior, activity budget, and individual variation for an important predator of the mesopelagos over temporal and spatial scales not previously possible.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"(1) Leopards are often translocated away from where they are caught as non-lethal human-wildlife conflict mitigation. It is alleged that leopards fail to settle where they are translocated to, owing to territoriality. We address the need to publish more accounts of successful repatriation of leopards, but also include novel applications aimed at orphans and confiscated leopards. (2) We satellite collared 16 leopards which included a mixture of relocated, and translocated leopards, of which the latter included conventional Damage Causing Animals (DCAs, viz 'problem animals'), orphans and confiscations. We determined standard home- range metrics and assessed home-range stabilisation as a means of determining site fidelity. Premature mortality and site infidelity, i.e homing back to origins, were considered failures. We looked at range stabilisation by examining successive monthly ranges against that of the preceeding month, i.e UDOIs. (3) Relocations turned out to be residents (~3 km, n=3), while they were immune to intervention, while translocations resulted in 50% success (n=12), which were invariably confiscated adults of unknown origin, and simulations of natal dispersals of orphans (~25 km, n =3). DCAs never settled where released (~90 km, n = 5). Resident leopards showed high monthly UDOIs, and for those translocated, a minimum of 0.15 was benchmarked to suggest range stability, which also reflected large spatial ranging. (4) Success in HR establishment was associated with landscapes which were unsaturated by other leopards, but anthropogenic threats still persisted, such that survival after a year was ~45%, but was not different to the normal background mortality of areas outside protected areas in the country. Operations are costly, particularly that to do with veterinary treatment, immobilisation, collars and temporary keeping, but such costs can be carried by public interest groups.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"(1) Early arrival at breeding grounds is of prime importance for migrating birds as it is known to enhance breeding success. Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. \\n(2) To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. \\n(3) GPS and body\\u2010acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012\\u20102016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. \\n(4) At the inter\\u2010individual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry\\u2010over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. \\n(5) This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted: (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade\\u2010off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality, and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature\\u2010arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.\",\n",

By closing up, diverging and covering the lines of a journey by a human and three birds telling the story of a humaninmalistic traveltangle. For one migration period the artist Moritz Matschke sets off on journey with three storks called Twix, Soweiwa and S\\u00fcwe IV from Germany. Destination and route will be decided by the birds. At the beginning of the trip it is not clear where they will overwinter. Everything is possible between a moroccan fishing village and a spanish garbage dump. Both storks and human are equipped with a DF transmitter and connected via satellite. Like a cats cradle the figures of the routes get formed and dissolved by each other. Storks, humans and apparatus get together to make each other capable of creating new ways of togetherness in a world of possible cross-species relationships.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The avian hippocampal formation (HF) is homologous to the mammalian hippocampus and plays a central role in the control of spatial cognition. In homing pigeons, HF supports navigation by familiar landmarks and landscape features. However, what has remained relatively unexplored is the importance of HF for the retention of previously acquired spatial information. For example, to date, no systematic GPS-tracking studies on the retention of HF-dependent navigational memory in homing pigeons have been performed. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the pre- and post-surgical navigational performance of sham-lesioned control and HF-lesioned pigeons tracked from three different sites located in different directions with respect to home. The pre- and post-surgical comparison of the pigeons\\u2019 flight paths near the release sites and before reaching the area surrounding the home loft (4\\u2009km radius from the loft) revealed that the control and HF-lesioned pigeons displayed similarly successful retention. By contrast, the HF-lesioned pigeons displayed dramatically and consistently impaired retention in navigating to their home loft during the terminal phase of the homing flight near home, i.e., where navigation is supported by memory for landmark and landscape features. The data demonstrate that HF lesions lead to a dramatic loss of pre-surgically acquired landmark and landscape navigational information while sparing those mechanisms associated with navigation from locations distant from home.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Flying foxes provide ecologically and economically important ecosystem services but extensive clearing and modification of habitat and drought combined with the planting of commercial and non-commercial trees across various landscapes, has meant flying foxes in Australia are increasingly seeking foraging resources in new areas. In 2011, grey-headed flying foxes formed a camp in Adelaide, South Australia, outside their previously recorded range. We used global positioning system telemetry to study the movements and foraging behaviour of this species in Adelaide in spring (September to November) 2015. High-frequency location data were used to determine the foraging range and the most frequently visited foraging sites used by each bat which were ground-truthed to identify forage plants. A total of 7239 valid locations were collected over 170 nights from four collars. Despite being a highly mobile species, the mean core foraging range estimate was only 7.30\\u2009km2 (range 3.3\\u201311.2\\u2009km2). Maximum foraging distance from the camp in the Botanic Park was 9.5\\u2009km but most foraging occurred within a 4-km radius. The most common foraging sites occurred within the residential area of Adelaide and included introduced forage plant species, Lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora) and Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa). Other observed movement activities included dipping behaviour on inland and marine waters and travel across flight paths around Adelaide airport. Our findings suggest that urban habitats in Adelaide provide sufficient foraging resources for grey-headed flying foxes to use these areas exclusively, at least in spring. This creates substantial opportunities for bats to interact with humans and their infrastructure.\",\n",

Recent studies have shown that grazing ecosystems are much more complex and dynamic than was previously assumed and that pastoralists adaptively manage these systems. However, we still have little understanding how everyday herding affects ecosystems at the landscape level. We conducted a study of daily herd movements and grazing strategies in a mobile pastoral system in the Logone floodplain, Cameroon. We integrated GPS/GIS technology, video recordings of animal behavior, and ethnographic methods to develop a more accurate measurement of grazing pressure that takes into account both livestock densities and grazing behavior. We used the resulting grazing pressure data to evaluate existing conceptual models of grazing pressure at a landscape level. We found that models that predict that grazing pressure is skewed towards the direction of water most accurately reflect the situation in the Logone floodplain in the dry season. However, we found that the higher grazing pressure is not only the result of a higher density of cattle but also a change in the grazing behavior of animals after watering. Finally, we caution that the models of grazing pressure in the dry season cannot simply be extrapolated to the landscape level because mobile pastoralists do not remain in one central place.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The biology and ecology of Africa\\u2019s largest fruit bat remains largely understudied and enigmatic despite at least two highly unusual attributes. The acoustic lek mating behavior of the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) in the Congo basin was first described in the 1970s. More recently molecular testing implicated this species and other African bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted ~100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is ~1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement. Moreover, our pilot demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing future studies on hammer-headed bats that will help fill problematic knowledge gaps about zoonotic spillover risks and the conservation needs of fruit bats across the continent.\",\n",

Elk were captured by this using helicopter net gunning. Captures occurred January through March in each year from 2007 to 2011. A vestibular canine was taken using dental lifters during the capture to assess age through cementum analysis. All males were ~1.5 years of age because net gunning was limited to capturing only young bulls with one-point (spike) antlers. Therefore, males were dispersing when just over 2 years old. Age of females ranged from 2 to 19 years old. Males were fitted with Lotek ARGOS GPS radiotelemetry collars, whereas females were fitted with Lotek GPS-4400 radiotelemetry collars (Lotek wireless Inc., Ontario, Canada). All collars were programmed with a 2-h relocation schedule. Satellite transmitted data of males were received weekly via email, whereas data of females were remotely downloaded in the field. Males made up a vast majority of the dispersing population, while most females remain resident or migratory.\",\n",

However, the winter range of this subspecies is not well understood, so we fitted 29 males with archival GPS tags during summer 2016. Four tagged thrushes were recaptured in summer 2017 and, though all tags had missing locations and broken antennae, the data retrieved showed that one thrush wintered in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM) in northern Colombia, one in the nearby Sierra de Perij\\u00e1 in Venezuela, and a third may have settled in the same region. One tag provided locations until April 21 and that thrush was consistently detected within a ~1 ha area through the winter. Locations obtained during fall migration indicated that thrushes travelled to South America via Central America and possibly by directly crossing the Caribbean. Contemporary research indicates that the SNSM is an important migratory stopover for Northern Gray-cheeked Thrushes (C. m. aliciae) but a historical report coupled with our observations suggest winter use of the SNSM and adjacent areas in northern South America by C. m. minimus, though numbers may be lower than during the 1900s.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"(1) Animals are often required to make decisions about their use of current resources while minimising travel costs and risks due to uncertainty about the forthcoming resources. Passive soaring birds utilise warm rising\\u2010air columns (thermals) to climb up and obtain potential energy for flying across large areas. However, the utilisation of such inconsistent natural resources may be challenging for soaring\\u2010gliding birds and involve a set of decisions to maintain efficient flight. (2) To assess which temporal scales of previous experience with environmental inputs best predicted thermal\\u2010climbing departure decisions of soaring birds, we used movement data from Eurasian griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) tracked by GPS transmitters. We applied Cox proportional hazard regression and a model selection approach to identify thermal\\u2010climbing departure decisions and to compare a range of temporal scales. (3) Our findings support the use of current and recent (short\\u2010term; last 20 minutes) experiences, compared to longer term, past experiences, in predicting the time until departure from thermals. The models supported decision rules that integrated information originating from different temporal scales, implying a tendency to depart from a thermal later when the current climb rate was stronger than experienced recently and vice\\u2010versa. Additionally, climb rates in thermals revealed significant autocorrelation over short time scales (shorter than 30 minutes). (4) The correspondence between thermals\\u2019 characteristics and the factors that best predicted thermal\\u2010climbing departure decisions presumably reflect optimal decisions individuals make to handle their dynamic environment and to reduce movement\\u2010related costs of such a basic activity for soaring\\u2010gliding birds.\",\n",

We used experimental food supply and high-resolution GPS tracking of free-ranging vultures to quantify search efficiency and elucidate the factors underlying the observed interspecific differences using a biased correlated random walk simulation model bootstrapped with the GPS tracking data. We found that LFV\\u2019s search efficiency was higher than WBV\\u2019s in both first-to-find, first-to-land, and per-individual-finding rate measures. Interspecific differences in morphology (through the effect on perceptual range and motion ability) and searchers\\u2019 spatial dispersion (due to different roost arrangements) are in correspondence with the empirically observed advantage of LFV over WBV searchers, whereas differences in other aspects of the movement patterns appear to play a minor role.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"When animals move, their tracks may be strongly influenced by the motion of air or water, and this may affect the speed, energetics and prospects of the journey. Flying organisms, such as bats, may thus benefit from modifying their flight in response to the wind vector. Yet, practical difficulties have so far limited the understanding of this response for free-ranging bats. We tracked nine straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) that flew 42.5+17.5km (mean + s.d.) to and from their roost near Accra, Ghana. Following detailed atmospheric simulations, we found that bats compensated for wind drift, as predicted under constant winds, and decreased their airspeed in response to tailwind assistance such that their groundspeed remained nearly constant. In addition, bats increased their airspeed with increasing crosswind speed. Overall, bats modulated their airspeed in relation to wind speed at different wind directions in a manner predicted by a two-dimensional optimal move- ment model. We conclude that sophisticated behavioural mechanisms to minimize the cost of transport under various wind conditions have evolved in bats. The bats\\u2019 response to the wind is similar to that reported for migratory birds and insects, suggesting convergent evolution of flight behaviours in volant organisms.\",\n",

The L\\u00e9vy-flight foraging hypothesis (LFFH) suggests a single optimal food search strategy to explain this pattern, yet mixed movement distributions are biologically more plausible and often convincingly fit movement data. To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution GPS/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic and morphological data. The L\\u00e9vy distribution fitted the datasets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet, the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)\\u2014rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three species\\u2014do not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time. We conclude that inference about the mechanisms underlying animal movements should be confronted with complementary data, and suggest that mixed behavioral-modes likely explain commonly observed fat-tailed movement distributions.\",\n",

Experimental evidence has shown that adult birds can correct for such displacements and return to their goal. However, the nature of the cues used by migratory birds to perform long distance navigation is still debated. In this experiment we subjected adult lesser black-backed gulls migrating from their Finnish/Russian breeding grounds (from >60\\u00b0N) to Africa (to < 5\\u00b0N) to sensory manipulation, to determine the sensory systems required for navigation. We translocated birds westward (1080 km) or eastward (885 km) to simulate natural navigational challenges. When translocated westwards and outside their migratory corridor birds with olfactory nerve section kept a clear directional preference (southerly) but were unable to compensate for the displacement, while intact birds and gulls with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve sectioned oriented towards their population-specific migratory corridor. Thus, air-borne olfactory information seems to be important for migrating gulls to navigate successfully in some circumstances. All analysis was done using the GPS data (not Argos Doppler) in this study.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"<b>Please contact Martin Wikelski for more information about the use of the acceleration data.</b> Steatornis caripensis (the oilbird) is a very unusual bird. It supposedly never sees daylight, roosting in huge aggregations in caves during the day and bringing back fruit to the cave at night. As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil. Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests. We also show that colony-living comes with high activity costs to individuals.\",\n",

These data were originally published in: Hays GC, Mortimer JA, Rattray A, Shimada T, Esteban E (2021). High accuracy tracking reveals how small conservation areas can protect marine megafauna. Ecological Applications. Please note that these data are complete and unfiltered. Please contact the Principal Investigator Professor Graeme Hays (g.hays@deakin.edu.au) for further details.\\n\\nSpace use estimates can inform conservation management but relaying high-accuracy locations is often not straightforward. We used Fastloc-GPS Argos satellite tags with the innovation of additional data relay via a ground station (termed a \\u201cMote\\u201d) to record high volumes (typically > 20 locations per individual per day) of high accuracy tracking data. Tags were attached in the Chagos Archipelago in 2018-2019 to 23 immature turtles of two species for which there have been long-standing conservation concerns: 21 hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) and two green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Over long tracking durations (mean 227.6 days per individual), most turtles moved very little. For example, 17 of 21 hawksbill turtles remained continuously in the lagoon where they were equipped, with 95% and 50% Utilisation Distributions (UDs) averaging only 1.03 and 0.18 km2 respectively. Many individuals, and both species, could use the same small spaces, i.e., individuals did not maintain unique home ranges. However, three hawksbill turtles travelled 100s of km from the tagging site. Our results show that for some large marine vertebrates, even small protected areas of only a few km2 can encompass the movements of a large proportion of individuals over long periods. High accuracy tracking may likewise reveal the details of space use for many other animals that move little and/or use important focal areas and where previous low-accuracy tracking techniques have tended to overestimate space use.\",\n",

In this paper we used mobility data and remote sensing data from two seasonal grazing areas at the end of the dry season in three consecutive years to evaluate that hypothesis. We found evidence of an IFD in the two seasonal grazing areas of the Logone Floodplain and the Lake Maga area. These findings offer further support for our hypothesis that there is a complex adaptive system in which pastoralists distribute themselves effectively over available grazing resources.\",\n",

What information individuals use for movement coordination is, however, very difficult to know, except for echolocating bats. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, we can accurately measure the biosonar calls of interacting bats with a group of microphones and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. When observing pairs of Daubenton's bats foraging low over water for stranded insects, we found they have intriguing `traffic rules' - they chase each other, perform tandem turns and even slow down to avoid collision. When we then modelled their biosonar view of the surroundings during these interactions we discovered that one simple trick suffices to create all their interactive behaviours: once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual's flight direction within 4-5 of your own wingbeats.<br>NOTE: Sensor type is 2D videogrammetry, not GPS.

Studies of flight and its impact on the movement ecology of birds must consider the wind to help us understand aerodynamics and bird flight strategies. Here, we introduce a systematic approach to evaluate wind speed and direction from the high-frequency GPS recordings from bird-borne tags during thermalling flight. Our method assumes that a fixed horizontal mean wind speed during a short (18 seconds, 19 GPS fixes) flight segment with a constant turn angle along a closed loop, characteristic of thermalling flight, will generate a fixed drift for each consequent location. We use a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate that drift and to determine the wind and airspeeds at the birds' flight locations. We also provide error estimates for these GPS-derived wind speed estimates. We validate our approach by comparing its wind estimates with the mid-resolution weather reanalysis data from ECMWF, and by examining independent wind estimates from pairs of birds in a large dataset of GPS-tagged migrating storks that were flying in close proximity. Our approach provides accurate and unbiased observations of wind speed and additional detailed information on vertical winds and uplift structure. These precise measurements are otherwise rare and hard to obtain and will broaden our understanding of atmospheric conditions, flight aerodynamics, and bird flight strategies. With an increasing number of GPS-tracked animals, we may soon be able to use birds to inform us about the atmosphere they are flying through and thus improve future ecological and environmental studies.\",\n",

We investigated how the temporal scaling of allometric patterns in movement vary over the course of a year, specifically during periods of motivated (directional and fast movement) and unmotivated (stationary and tortuous movement) behaviour and used state-space modelling to estimate seven different movement metrics of Galapagos tortoises. Allometric scaling of movement was more apparent during motivated periods of movement. During this period, allometry was revealed at multiple temporal intervals (hourly, daily, and monthly), with values observed at daily and monthly intervals corresponding most closely to the expected 1\\u20444 scaling coefficient, albeit with wide credible intervals. We further detected differences in the magnitude of scaling among taxa uncoupled from observed differences in the temporal structuring of their movement rates. Our results indicate that the definition of temporal scales is fundamental to the detection of allometry of movement, and should be given more attention in movement studies.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Background: Characterizing the movement patterns of animals is an important step in understanding their ecology. Various methods have been developed for classifying animal movement at both coarse (e.g., migratory vs. sedentary behavior) and fine (e.g., resting vs. foraging) scales. A popular approach for classifying movements at coarse resolutions involves fitting time series of net-squared displacement (NSD) to models representing different conceptualizations of coarse movement strategies (i.e., migration, nomadism, sedentarism, etc.). However, the performance of this method in classifying actual (as opposed to simulated) animal movements has been mixed. Here, we develop a more flexible method that uses the same NSD input, but relies on an underlying discrete latent state model. Using simulated data, we first assess how well patterns in the number of transitions between modes of movement and the duration of time spent in a mode classify movement strategies. We then apply our approach to elucidate variability in the movement strategies of eight giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.) using a multi-year (2009\\u20132014) GPS dataset from three different Galapagos Islands. Results: With respect to patterns of time spent and the number of transitions between modes, our approach out- performed previous efforts to distinguish among migration, dispersal, and sedentary behavior. We documented marked inter-individual variation in giant tortoise movement strategies, with behaviors indicating migration, dispersal, nomadism and sedentarism, as well as hybrid behaviors such as \\u201cexploratory residence\\u201d. Conclusions: Distilling complex animal movement into discrete modes remains a fundamental challenge in movement ecology, a problem made more complex by the ever-longer duration, ever-finer resolution, and gap-ridden trajectories recorded by GPS devices. By clustering into modes, we derived information on the time spent within one mode and the number of transitions between modes which enabled finer differentiation of movement strategies over previous methods. Ultimately, the techniques developed here address limitations of previous approaches and provide greater insights with respect to characterization of movement strategies across scales by more fully utilizing long-term GPS telemetry datasets.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The field of movement ecology has rapidly grown during the last decade, with important advancements in tracking devices and analytical tools that have provided unprecedented insights into where, when, and why species move across a landscape. Although there has been an increasing emphasis on making animal movement data publicly available, there has also been a conspicuous dearth in the availability of such data on large carnivores. Globally, large predators are of conservation concern. However, due to their secretive behavior and low densities, obtaining movement data on apex predators is expensive and logistically challenging. Consequently, the relatively small sample sizes typical of large carnivore movement studies may limit insights into the ecology and behavior of these elusive predators. The aim of this initiative is to make available to the conservation-scientific community a dataset of 134,690 locations of jaguars (Panthera onca) collected from 117 individuals (54 males and 63 females) tracked by GPS technology. [The published dataset here represents a portion of this dataset.] Individual jaguars were monitored in five different range countries representing a large portion of the species\\u2019 distribution. This dataset may be used to answer a variety of ecological questions including but not limited to: improved models of connectivity from local to continental scales; the use of natural or human-modified landscapes by jaguars; movement behavior of jaguars in regions not represented in this dataset; intraspecific interactions; and predator-prey interactions. In making our dataset publicly available, we hope to motivate other research groups to do the same in the near future. Specifically, we aim to help inform a better understanding of jaguar movement ecology with applications towards effective decision making and maximizing long-term conservation efforts for this ecologically important species. There are no costs, copyright, or proprietary restrictions associated with this data set. When using this data set, please cite this article to recognize the effort involved in gathering and collating the data and the willingness of the authors to make it publicly available.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Movement strategies of animals have been well studied as a function of ecological drivers (e.g., forage selection and avoiding predation) rather than physiological requirements (e.g., thermoregulation). Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10\\u201330 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a \\u201clandscape of thermal stress.\\\"\",\n",

The data set consists of movement data for 175 camps, which consist of multiple households with their herds of cattle, during 2007-2011. We documented the annual transhumance of mobile pastoralists using a combination of surveys and mapping campsites with GPS. In the survey, we asked pastoralists the names and number of days of all the campsites they had stayed in the previous year. We also recorded the number of pastoral households. Then we used GPS technology to map the locations of the campsites that pastoralists listed in the transhumance surveys.\",\n",

The GPS functioned well during the 197-day tracking period. Home range sizes ranged between 4.9 and 8.1 km2, depending on the estimation method. Movement speeds averaged 0.17 km/h at day versus 0.87 km/h at night, and distance traveled averaged 0.23 km at day versus 0.89 km at night. These preliminary results highlight the importance of collecting unbiased, high-quality data which enables an enhanced understanding on mammal behavior and human/animal interaction.\",\n",

The species is critically endangered in Peru, so a major aim of the study was to aid conservation planning by learning the wet season location of the country\\u2019s last known breeding population. We captured a breeding pair on October 27, 2010, and fitted the birds with Microwave Telemetry, Inc. GPS/Argos satellite PTTs. The pair migrated ~ 655 km from Man\\u00fa National Park to the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia (Dept. of Ben\\u00ed) in a predominantly longitudinal migration, reaching their final destination on December 23, 2010. Major movements (>5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle. Orinoco Geese are resident in the Llanos de Moxos year-round, so the Man\\u00fa geese represent a partial migration from the Ben\\u00ed region. We hypothesize that cavity nest limitation explains the partial migration of Orinoco Geese from the Llanos de Moxos.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Context. Fenced reserves from which invasive predators are removed are increasingly used as a conservation management tool, because they provide safe havens for susceptible threatened species, and create dense populations of native wildlife that could act as a source population for recolonising the surrounding landscape. However, the latter effect might also act as a food source, and promote high densities of invasive predators on the edges of such reserves. Aims. Our study aimed to determine whether activity ofthe feral cat is greater around the edges ofa fenced conservation\\nreserve, Arid Recovery, in northern South Australia. This reserve has abundant native rodents that move through the fence into the surrounding landscape. Methods. We investigated (1) whether feral cats were increasingly likely to be detected on track transects closer to the\\nfence over time as populations ofnative rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) whether native rodents were more likely to be found in the stomachs ofcats caught close to the reserve edge, and (3) whether individual cats selectively hunted on the reserve fence compared with two other similar fences, on the basis ofGPS movement data. Key results. We found that (1) detection rates of feral cats on the edges of a fenced reserve increased through time as populations of native rodents increased inside the reserve, (2) native rodents were far more likely to be found in the stomach ofcats collected at the reserve edge than in the stomachs ofcats far from the reserve edge, and (3) GPS tracking of cat movements showed a selection for the reserve fence edge, but not for similar fences away from the reserve. Conclusions. Invasive predators such as feral cats are able to focus their movements and activity to where prey availability is greatest, including the edges offenced conservation reserves. This limits the capacity ofreserves to function as source areas from which animals can recolonise the surrounding landscape, and increases predation pressure on populations of other species living on the reserve edge. Implications. Managers offenced conservation reserves should be aware that increased predator control may be critical\\nfor offsetting the elevated impacts of feral cats attracted to the reserve fence.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Anim. Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds\\u2019 incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage. PLoS One: Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/ 0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study. Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein, triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1\\u20133 days) showed limited impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey. Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.\",\n",

Plasticity in movement strategies allows a species to better track spatial dynamics of habitat quality. We describe the mechanisms that shape the movement of a long-distance migrant bird (turkey vulture, Cathartes aura) across two continents using satellite tracking coupled with remote-sensing science. Using nearly 10 years of data from 24 satellite-tracked vultures in four distinct populations, we describe an enormous amount of variation in their movement patterns. We related vulture movement to environmental conditions and found important correlations explaining how far they need to move to find food (indexed by the normalized difference vegetation index) and how fast they can move based on the prevalence of thermals and temperature. We conclude that the extensive variability in the movement ecology of turkey vultures, facilitated by their energetically efficient thermal soaring, suggests that this species is likely to do well across periods of modest climate change. The large scale and sample sizes needed for such analysis in a widespread migrant emphasizes the need for integrated and collaborative efforts to obtain tracking data and for policies, tools and open datasets to encourage such collaborations and data sharing.\",\n",

The cause is unclear, but predation by feral cats, intensification of fire regimes, and grazing by introduced herbivores have all been implicated. These factors might interact if predation rates of feral cats on small mammals is amplified by the changes in fire and grazing regimes. To test for such an interaction, we investigated fine-scale habitat selection by feral cats in relation to fire, grazing and small-mammal abundance.\",\n",

Birds flew simultaneously in the same airspace, but were released in two groups split by age (Juveniles n = 3 and adults n = 2), with a 5 minute stagger between them. The experiment was performed in this way to test for any influence of social information on soaring performance. Animal attached GPS loggers (Gipsy 1, TechnoSmart, separately uploaded into Movebank) and Daily Diary (DD) bio-logging units (data uploaded here) were secured to an aluminium plate with Velcro which was positioned on the lower back via a Teflon leg-loop harness. DD units used a differential pressure sensor to measure airflow (Volts) as the difference between static and dynamic pressure recorded through a forward-facing brass Pitot tube.\",\n",

Using new, archival GPS loggers, we tracked individual purple martins (Progne subis) from breeding colonies across North America to determine precise (<10m) locations of migratory and overwintering roost locations in South America and to test hypotheses for fine-scale migratory connectivity and habitat use. We discovered weak migratory connectivity at the roost scale, and extensive, fine-scale mixing of birds in the Amazon from distant (>2000 km) breeding sites, with some individuals sharing the same roosting trees. Despite vast tracts of contiguous forest in this region, birds occupied a much more limited habitat, with most (56%) roosts occurring on small habitat islands that were strongly associated with water. Only 17% of these roosts were in current protected areas. These data reflect a critical advance in our ability to remotely determine precise migratory connectivity and habitat selection across vast spatial scales, enhancing our understanding of population dynamics and enabling more effective conservation of species at risk.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is the most widely distributed, as well as the most abundant, of all scavenging birds of prey.  The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America.  Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.  Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists:  including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands.  The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as \\u201cbreezy cleanser,\\u201d most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. \\n\\nScientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not.  Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas.  Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina.  Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.\\n\\nAs scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems.  Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year.  The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys.  To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring.  Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities.  The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate.  Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity.  The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.\\n\",\n",

Environmental odours have been demonstrated to be critical to homeward navigation in over 40 years of experiments, yet the chemical identity of the odours has remained unknown. In this study, we investigate potential chemical navigational cues by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs): at the birds\\u2019 home-loft; in selected regional forest environments; and from an aircraft at 180 m. The measurements showed clear regional, horizontal and vertical spatial gradients that can form the basis of an olfactory map for marine emissions (dimethyl sulphide, DMS), biogenic compounds (terpenoids) and anthropogenic mixed air (aromatic compounds), and temporal changes consistent with a sea-breeze system. Air masses trajectories are used to examine GPS tracks from released birds, suggesting that local DMS concentrations alter their flight directions in predictable ways. This dataset reveals multiple regional-scale real-world chemical gradients that can form the basis of an olfactory map suitable for homing pigeons.\",\n",

We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA. There was a small, but negative, relationship between airspeed and ODBA, and bats decreased ODBA with increasing tailwind. Bats flew at ground speeds of 9.6 \\u00b1 2.4 ms-1 (mean \\u00b1 sd, range: 4.3 to 23.9 ms-1) and airspeeds of 10.2 \\u00b1 2.5 ms-1, and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed. It is possible that the flexibility in wingbeat kinematics may make flight of free-ranging bats less costly than currently predicted or alternatively that the combination of ODBA and airspeed at our scales of measurement does not reflect this relationship in straw-colored fruit bats.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"Argos-linked archival tags with Fastloc GPS were deployed on free-ranging sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin whales (B. physalus) to derive empirical estimates of Argos location errors for these species, examine possible behavior-related differences, and test the effect of incorporating species-specific error parameters on performance of a commonly used movement model. Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9\\u00b0C versus 1.3\\u00b0C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.\",\n",

      "    \"study_objective\": \"This dataset incorporates satellite tracks from 235 marine turtles across an 11 year tagging effort. There are 3 species in this dataset - loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata). Using this data, we developed a model using step selection analysis to quantify sea turtle habitat use within the study area, specifically as it relates to marine protected area boundaries. We are providing the summary information from the state space modeling (SSM), not the raw tracking data. When gaps of many days occur in the raw data, the resulting track becomes less informed by data and thus less reliable the longer the gap is. Thus, we split individual tracks with gaps longer than 25 days, and we passed these tracks to the SSM as if they were separate individuals. This resulted in 278 tracks from 235 individual turtles. \",\n",

The study has been operational since 2018. In total 13 individuals of Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) have been tagged in their breeding area in East Flanders (Belgium), west of the river Scheldt, mainly to study their habitat use on mudflats of the Western Scheldt (the Netherlands). Data from active or new trackers are periodically uploaded from the UvA-BiTS database to Movebank (see https://github.com/inbo/bird-tracking) and then Zenodo.\",\n",
